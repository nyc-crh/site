To help teachers imagine and create ways to use primary sources from the NYC Civil Rights History Project in their classrooms, we have created sample lesson plans. These are not for prescription, but for inspiration. We hope that teachers will draw on their own knowledge to remix and recreate what is here in ways that work for their students, their community, and their subject area.
