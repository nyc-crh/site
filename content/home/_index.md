Welcome to the New York City Civil Rights History Project. As educators, scholars, activists, and students, we chose this title because many New York City teachers and students already recognize that the civil rights movement in the US is important to teach and learn about. But students receive a limited and incomplete representation of this history, especially when it comes to the educational system. We hope the name of the project is an invitation to think about something familiar in a new way.

The New York City Civil Rights History Project (NYCCRHP) is an in-progress collaborative effort between:

- youth and adult activists,
- scholars,
- educators,
- public history organizations.

The project was inspired by New York City high school student activists who wanted to understand the history of their city and schools. This site is a resource for teachers to explore histories of racist and ableist segregation in our schools. And, to tell about the effort of community activists to seek educational justice for all students.
