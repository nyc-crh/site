As educators, scholars, activists, and students, we chose the name "New York City Civil Rights History Project" because we recognize that the civil rights movement in the US is important to teach and learn about. But students often receive a limited, and therefore incorrect, representation of this history. We hope the name of this site is an invitation to think about something familiar in a new way.

A team of scholars, educators, activists, and advocates contributed to this project. [Find out how our work started, who has been involved, and how it developed](/project-history).

This project is housed at the [Center on History and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University]( https://www.tc.columbia.edu/che/).

## Feedback

History is always a work in progress. Interpretations of the past change as we learn more through finding new sources, and from applying new ideas and questions to the sources we have. The New York City Civil Rights Project is a work in progress in this sense and in others. There is so much yet to learn about how students of color and disabled students experienced education in New York City, and how they and those who loved them fought for justice. And there is much left to learn about how best to teach these histories.Thank you for keeping this in mind as you explore our work. We look forward to your comments, questions, and ideas.
