bio: Justin Hauver taught history for 8 years. In the classroom, he saw theories of justice come alive in challenging and wonderful ways as he and his students unpacked the history of the US. His work continues to explore and co-create pedagogies of liberation. 
workonproject: His contributions to this project focused on collaborating with Ivelisse Ramos to develop 8th and 11th grade social studies curricular materials grounded in primary sources from the NYCCRHP. We created flexible unit plans, complete with daily lesson plans and activity handouts, that center the educational activism of women of color in New York, studentsâ€™ experiences of segregation in NYC, and the struggle for Disability Justice.
