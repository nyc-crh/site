bio: Noa Ovadia is a PhD student at Teachers College, Columbia University in the Teaching of Social Studies program, where she researches the civic identity formation of transnational youth. She is a former high school civics teacher and debate educator.
workonproject: Noa's contribution to the project was the development of a semester-long 12th-grade Participation in Government curriculum based on the materials crafted by the NYCCRHP, which aims to foster historical thinking and build civic engagement while aligning with the New York State Social Studies Standards. Teachers can leverage this curriculum outline to build a course which resonates with students' experiences, is instructive of civic processes, and develops critical thinking about social issues.
