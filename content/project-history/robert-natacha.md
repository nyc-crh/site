bio: Natacha Robert is a doctoral student at Teachers College, Columbia University. She is a former middle and high school social studies and special education teacher and founder of Elimu for Liberation, an educational consulting company.
workonproject: Her contributions to this project focused on African American, Latino, and disability educational justice. I created an 11-day mini unit and two day lesson for grade 11 that explores the issue of segregation and school desegregation with a focus on New York. The lessons use primary source documents to analyze the issue of segregation through the intersection of disability, race, and ethnicity. With modifications the unit and two day lesson can be taught in grade 8.
