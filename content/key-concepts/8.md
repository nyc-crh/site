Black New Yorkers protested the segregation of their schools throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 1954 *Brown v. Board of Education* decision, the Supreme Court ruled that school segregation by race violated the U.S. Constitution.[^1] The New York City Board of Education talked a lot about racial desegregation in the 1950s and 1960s but made few actual changes, even after major activism by Black and Puerto Rican New Yorkers and those working in solidarity with them.[^2]

Segregation or exclusion of disabled students continued as well. The Supreme Court’s ruling in *Brown* did not mention disabled students, but the case paved the way for the courts to recognize the rights of disabled students several decades later.[^3] Legal recognition of these rights helped increase disabled students access to schooling, but many policies and practices in special education continued to segregate students in and between schools.[^4]

Since 1970, New York has operated District 75, a separate school district only for disabled students. Like many special education programs within schools or classrooms, this district is predominantly Black and Latinx students, illustrating continued segregation in terms of race *and* ability [^5] Six decades after *Brown*, a team of researchers identified New York State’s schools as the most racially segregated in the country, and NYC one of the most segregated districts.[^6]
