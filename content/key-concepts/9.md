Imagine an all-Black youth club, or a school for Deaf children led by Deaf educators. Are these examples of segregated institutions?

Students of color and disabled students and their advocates were often denied the opportunity to exercise power or control in white-dominated schools and those built for non-disabled students. One way they have responded was to create their own schools or other places for learning that reflected their self-determination, that is, their ability to shape and guide themselves and their own institutions. These spaces reflected a desire for being together, giving support, and taking strength from one another, because of, or in spite of, racism and ableism in the broader society.[^54]

Because these institutions are created within historically marginalized communities, and because people choose to join them - rather than being required by others to do so - we do not apply the term “segregated” to these spaces.
