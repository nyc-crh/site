Students of all backgrounds and abilities are growing up in a city and a school system shaped by racism and ableism from the past unto the present. Students can better understand their city and their schools if they understand that race and disability are social categories and know how people in their city have constructed educational inequality. The history of ongoing, varied activism for justice in education can illustrate for students the ways that New Yorkers sought to make change in their city and their world. These histories can help all New York City students know that, as one of the NYCCRHP team members Judy DeRosier put it, “they are worthy, and people fought for them.”
