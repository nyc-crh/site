questions: 
- What do you think of how Mark Twain’s principal comments on his students’ academic struggles? What parts do you find convincing, and what parts do you disagree with? Why? 
- "At the end of the clip, a Black mother makes this comment about Mark Twain: \"It’s not a school... the only thing they actually learn is basketball and football.\" If Mark Twain was not a school to her, what do you imagine a school *should* be, in her view? What is your view of what a school should be?"
- How do unequal academic opportunities in school lead to more segregation in schools, in the past or present?
