*Palante* was a self-published newspaper in which the various branches of the Young Lords Party highlighted important issues in their communities. They examined social issues through a critical lens that unearthed how colonialism, capitalism, and racism created problems for Puerto Rican communities.

This cover is from the third issue of the third volume of *Palante.* It reflects the relationship between the Young Lords Party and the Black Panther Party, which were both nationalist organizations - meaning they were committed to self-determination. In other words, they wanted Black and Puerto Rican people to have control over the communities in which they lived. Both organizations built structures to help their communities, including health clinics, food programs, and more. And both refused to commit to non-violence, instead arguing that at times racist violence required an armed response.
