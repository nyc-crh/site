questions: 
- Notice the language on the area description forms. What terms give you a sense of how the HOLC (who made the forms) and local white real estate agents and business people (who filled them out) thought about the communities they were describing? 
- What criteria did local real estate agents hired by HOLC use to evaluate neighborhoods?
- Based on the area descriptions, which neighborhood characteristics did HOLC value? What groups of people did HOLC value and devalue?
- Who benefited from these maps and their judgments? How so? 
- How did HOLC’s evaluation contribute to segregated housing patterns?
