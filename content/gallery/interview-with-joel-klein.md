eventname: Chancellor Joel Klein speaks about expanding school choice.
caption: This video from the 74 Million, a news media outlet created by a school choice advocate, contains an interview with Joel Klein who became the Chancellor of the Department of Education after the New York State Legislature transferred control of the city’s school to the mayor’s office. As the Chancellor, Klein was in charge of the city’s school system.

questions: 
- What do you think were the most important issues to Joel Klein during the early years of mayoral control?
- In this video clip, Joel Klein talks about schools competing to “earn” their students. He thinks of children and parents as consumers of education and, therefore, schools (like businesses) compete for consumers. Based on this logic, some schools will succeed in attracting consumers (or students) and others will not. Those that do not succeed will be closed down. Thinking about your own experiences as a student, what are the strengths of this idea? What are the weaknesses? 
- As part of New York’s system of mayoral control, Joel Klein was appointed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg to the job of Chancellor. Many other school system leaders are being elected, or selected by an elected school board. How do you think that mayoral control affects Klein’s approach to his job? How do you think it affects his approach to making changes in the school system?
