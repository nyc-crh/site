*The Brownies’ Book* included different kinds of writing, visual art, and photography by adults. But it also included letters from readers. Black children from around the United States who read the magazine sometimes wrote back.[^1] What they chose to write about tells us what the *Brownies’ Book* meant to them and what was happening in their lives.
