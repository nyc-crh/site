According to New York’s Black newspaper the *Amsterdam News*, Double Dutch is “a skip-rope activity in which two ropes are turned in eggbeater fashion by two rope turners while a third person jumps within the moving ropes.”[^1] Double Dutch was a joyful form of exercise and in some cases competition. This image likely came from [a Double Dutch tournament at Lincoln Center in New York](/topics/joyful-struggle/double-dutch/kids-jump-for-prizes/).

The exact origins of the game, and its name, are not known for sure. But it is clear that by World War II, many Black girls grew up jumping Double Dutch on sidewalks and open spaces in their city neighborhoods. The game required physical and verbal skill.  Traditional rhymes sung from memory, and new ones that girls composed, were part of Double Dutch.

Double Dutch was a part of hip hop, as well. In the 1980s, Double Dutch was part of hip hop parties and performances. At an exposition in Paris in 1982, New York City Double Dutch champions the Fabulous Four performed alongside hip hop artists like Afrika Bambaataa, Fab 5 Freddy, and the Rock Steady Crew.[^2]

By the mid-1980s, hip hop’s four disciplines – MCing, DJing, graffiti, and breakdancing – had moved forward without Double Dutch. But Double Dutch continued to be a source of fun and exercise for many Black girls growing up in New York.
