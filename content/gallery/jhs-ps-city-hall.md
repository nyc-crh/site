During the February 3, 1964 boycott, there was a rally at City Hall. Students, teachers, and parents who were participating in the boycott gathered together to send a message to the mayor that they wanted action on desegregation. Simultaneously, small and large gatherings took place at schools around the city. A reporter from one of New Yorkâ€™s Black newspapers, the Amsterdam News, Jimmy Brooks, interviewed many participants. Their comments help us hear why people chose to participate in the boycott.w
