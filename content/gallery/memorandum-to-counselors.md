For Camp Jened to be accessible to disabled children and adults, staff and counselors had to work well with campers. Some of the staff at Camp Jened were disabled themselves, but all received training in how to support disabled youth and adults.[^1]

This document provided guidance to Jened counselors before they began their work. There was one counselor for every 2.5 campers, so that there were enough staff to provide the support campers might need.[^2]

In addition to interactions with counselors, campers received the health care they needed while at camp. Camp health care providers conferred with the campers’ regular doctors, and made a medical recommendation and physical therapy plan for each camper.[^3]

The number of campers varied. In 1955, there were 65 child campers and 25 adult campers. That year there were 10 speech therapists at the camp. Children at Camp Jened ranged in age from 3 years to 16 years of age.[^4]
