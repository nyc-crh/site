When Judge Jack Weinstein initially issued a court order to integrate District 21 schools, he proposed a wide-reaching plan that called for the Board of Education, District 21’s school board, and private real estate developers and housing officials to integrate the district’s neighborhoods and schools. White parents were furious with the decision and threatened to subvert the court order, leave the city, or withdraw their children from public schools. The district school board, whose members were all white, shared the white parents’ preference for segregation, but also felt that they had to meet the requirements of the court.

As a compromise to accommodate white parents’ preferences while also meeting the court requirements, the school board proposed turning Mark Twain into a “gifted and talented” school. They hoped that this would attract white parents to the school, and they assumed that more white students than Black or Latinx students would qualify for the school. The judge accepted the proposal and Curtis J. Berger, a Columbia Law School professor, drafted the plan.

The above *Amsterdam News* article captures how Dr. Kenneth Clark and others criticized the plan. Dr. Clark was a Black psychologist who had worked with his wife Dr. Mamie Phipps Clark in support of desegregation. Dr. Kenneth Clark saw the Mark Twain plan as an attempt “to evade the politically explosive issue of desegregation.” And he said it was an example of educational tracking, by which he meant unequal opportunities in a school’s curriculum and classes.

Despite Dr. Clark’s criticisms, the judge approved Berger’s plan and Mark Twain became a middle school known for its “gifted and talented” program.
