Many New Yorkers lived in poverty in the 1890s, and depended on their children to work to help support the family. Other young people had to make their way without families, and worked to support themselves. Therefore, these children did not attend school (which was not necessarily illegal at the time). Charitable or non-profit organizations like the Children’s Aid Society were founded by wealthy New Yorkers to help improve the living conditions of children who were working rather than attending school.  

The Children’s Aid Society operated a few "industrial schools" for children who worked in industry. The industrial schools tried to help students who could not attend school develop habits and knowledge that could help them in life.[^1]  

The industrial schools hoped to help shape children as US citizens. Many immigrant children came from places where citizens did not have democratic rights. Others, like Black migrants from the US South, had been excluded from democracy because of racist laws and practices. In this photograph, we see students at the Beach Street Industrial School, run by the Children’s Aid Society and staffed by volunteers, practicing democracy by voting on the question of whether each day should begin with a salute to the US flag.[^2]
