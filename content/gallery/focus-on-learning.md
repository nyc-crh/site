questions: 
- The researchers identify several criticisms of special education. Have these concerns been addressed, or do they continue today? 
- Although most students in special education attended schools in a community school district, others were in a separate district only for disabled students. Did disabled students experience “decentralized” school governance? How did this affect their parent’s ability to advocate for their children? 
- The researchers suggested that disabled students attend classrooms and schools with non-disabled students. Several disabled students and their parents raised concerns about this. What were the students' and parents' concerns?"]
