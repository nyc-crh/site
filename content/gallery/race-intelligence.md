questions: 
- What were DuBois’ criticisms of intelligence tests? There are several different ones, so make sure you find more than one. 
- >
 What did DuBois mean that “the average included most of both races”? How are the mathematic concepts of “average” and “range” a part of his argument? 
- What do you notice about DuBois’ rhetorical style? How did he write this piece? How do you think he wanted his readers to feel? 
- >
 DuBois points out one kind of question on the IQ test and implies - but does not state why - it is unfair. Why is it unfair to ask test takers to “complete pictures where the net was missing in the tennis court or the ball in the bowling alley”?  
- >
 What criticisms do you have of the other items on the [test](/gallery/army-test)?

Scholar W.E.B. DuBois was an editor of *The Crisis*, a magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (or NAACP). DuBois wrote a short editorial in the magazine, responding to claims that intelligence test scores showed Black people to be less intelligent than white people.

DuBois deployed several arguments against this claim that, while false as he said, has remained enduring.

DuBois also placed intelligence tests on a long timeline of attempts to find a biological basis for claims of racial superiority or inferiority. White supremacists had tried to weigh the brains of deceased people and categorize those by race. Then there was “craniometry,” or the measuring of skulls. Neither were sources of meaningful information, and nor was the intelligence test, DuBois implied.
