 [Mallory had been active in many political struggles in New York and nationally](https://www.aaihs.org/mae-mallory-forgotten-black-power-intellectual/). The FBI targeted Mae Mallory for surveillance within its COINTELPRO program. Mallory’s [extensive FBI file includes other images of her](https://vault.fbi.gov/mae-mallory). How do the images of Mallory collected by the FBI compare to this image?

During the “Harlem Nine”'s struggle to integrate schools in New York City, multiple newspapers, including the *New York Times* and *Amsterdam News,* published photographs of Mae Mallory with her daughter Patricia. These images accompanied articles about the legal struggles of Mallory and the other Harlem mothers who had been charged with violating the state’s compulsory education law when they kept their children out of school. In some ways, she and her daughter became the face of the “Harlem Nine.”

While Mae Mallory may have consented to these photos, we might wonder how Patricia felt about her inclusion in the images and how she thought about and felt about the boycott.
