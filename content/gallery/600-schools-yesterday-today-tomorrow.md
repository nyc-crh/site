Organizing in the early 1960s by the Citywide Committee on Integration and Reverend Milton Galamison had increased public attention to the “600” schools. After newspaper coverage of misconduct by teachers and administrators at a “600”’ school in Brooklyn, as well as criticism over the schools being racially segregated, the Board of Education created a special committee to study conditions inside these schools. After two years of study, The report, “'600' Schools Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow," was delivered to the Superintendent of Schools in September 1966. The report acknowledged that the "600" schools were "ethnically unbalanced" and attributed this imbalance to the "many social problems and pressures to which these children are exposed," rather than "mental illness." While acknowledging that many problems existed within the "600" school system, the committee also highlighted the strengths of the program and the number of students who moved through the system, many of whom were considered "rehabilitated" and returned to the regular school system. They cited a need for more funding, personnel, and training to address the problems and improve the system.
