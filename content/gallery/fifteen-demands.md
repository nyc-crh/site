In 1969, high school students across the country were involved in a variety of kinds of activism, including protests against the Vietnam War. New York students also organized in pursuit of justice and equity in their own schools.[^1] Their efforts were separate from, but also influenced by, discussions of self-determination and democracy underway at the time.

This document shows a set of demands that Black and Latinx students working across several New York City high schools prepared. Notice how student concerns overlap with, but in some cases are different than, adult organizers'. Student organizers expressed their opposition to the presence and actions of police officers in New York City schools. Some adult organizers, like Preston Wilcox, were concerned about this issue, but many adult organizers at the time did not make it a priority.

The students organized a one-day boycott of their high schools, to demonstrate their commitment to these demands.[^2]
