On March 12, 1964 - between the first 1964 pro-integration boycott and the second - a group of white parents calling themselves “Parents and Taxpayers” led a march from the Board of Education building in Brooklyn to City Hall in Manhattan. White parents had organized and protested in favor of segregation earlier, as in the 1959 boycotts. This time, Parents and Taxpayers used many of the same protest tactics that civil rights activists used: marches and boycotts. They also claimed that they had to act to protect *their* rights, which they thought were threatened by desegregation plans. The name they chose for their group is important to notice. As historian Matthew Delmont has observed, by calling themselves Parents and Taxpayers, “these white protestors made an implicit claim that they occupied a higher level of citizenship than Black and Puerto Rican New Yorkers who were also parents and taxpayers.”[^1]

Although it was a very cold and wet day, as the silent film recorded by the New York Police Department shows, thousands of white parents, mostly mothers, made the march. They can be seen, through the fog, making their way across the Brooklyn Bridge.

Some of the signs included:

* We are against busing to any neighborhood
* No Bus No Fuss
* Fight Transfers. Do not submit
* PAT Rather fight than switch [schools]
* Jackson [Heights] PTA says preserve our neighborhood school
* The Board of Education is out of its head
* Neighborhood Schools for Neighborhood Children

This footage helps us see this moment in history. But it was not created for this purpose. According to the New York City Municipal Archives, this footage was recorded as part of the New York City Police Department’s surveillance program. “Throughout the 20th century, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) conducted overt \[or visible\] and covert \[or hidden\]  surveillance on groups and individuals identified as potential security threats to the City… The subjects include a broad range of political activist groups and events from 1960 to 1980.”[^2] That “broad range” includes many activists of color who were challenging racism and other kinds of injustice. The NYPD filmed protests against police brutality, against the Vietnam War, against racism in hiring construction workers, and more. The police perceived these activists, including the school boycotters, as “potential security threats.” That is one example of how Black and Latinx people, and those white people in solidarity with them, have been “criminalized” - or understood as criminals - in the US.[^3] In the NYPD surveillance films, it is unusual to see white people, and especially white women, engaged in political protest as they are here.
