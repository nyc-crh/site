In the 1830s, the City purchased Randall’s Island to use as a remote burial ground for the poor and as an almshouse. Blackwell’s and Wards Islands were purchased later, and more institutions were built on the three islands to house and care for “various indigent, criminal, ill, poor, and disabled populations.”[^1] Journalist W. H. Davenport visited the “Insane Asylum” and “Orphanage and Idiot Asylum,” publishing his accounts of the residents and life in those facilities.[^2] The articles give a view of the conditions in these early reform institutions. Non-disabled children at the orphanage were taught in classes overseen by the NYC Department of Education. Children with physical disabilities (of which there were many) were taught how to craft products that could be sold. Children at the “Idiot Asylum” also had classes with a goal of preparing them for “useful occupations.”[^3]

As the population of New York City grew, so did populations at these institutions. In the 1930s, the City decided to connect Randalls and Wards islands together, and connect them to the surrounding boroughs with bridges. They closed many of the institutions on the island to make way for a park and recreation area.[^4] While facilities on Randall’s Island closed, state institutions for the disabled, like Letchworth Village, continued to operate. Some residential institutions still remain on the islands today, like homeless shelters and a psychiatric hospital.
