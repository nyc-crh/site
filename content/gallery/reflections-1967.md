Located near the town of Hunter, New York, in the Catskill Mountains (a few hours from New York City), Camp Jened was unusual at the time for its focus on disabled campers.[^1]

What did campers at Camp Jened think about their time there? In the camp’s newsletter, campers wrote about their experiences at the camp, what they most liked, and what they learned. The newsletter “Reflections - August, 1967” helps us hear about the camp for young people and disabled adults in their own words.[^2]

Camper Denise Sherer Jacobson kept this copy of “Reflections,” decades after she was a camper in the 1960s. She recalls that students met twice a week to write for the camp newspaper. Some campers returned to Jened for multiple years and were part of the newspaper activity each year.[^3]

In “Reflections,” campers provide a catalog of the camp’s activities. Activities included gardening and hiking—which Jened worked to make accessible to those in wheelchairs—and more. Sherer Jacobson’s favorite activities were the ones that emphasized a feeling of community. For many, camp community continued for years, as campers who were part of the “Camp Jened Family” gathered at reunions to celebrate and reminisce.[^4]

Many campers later reflected that Camp Jened, during those months of July and August, felt like the first time they really had a community. The camp’s organizers wanted to encourage this feeling, because they were concerned that many disabled students felt isolated.[^5]
