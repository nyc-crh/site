No single civil rights organization represents all Black Americans. That was true in the 1960s and is true today. Different organizations have had different political visions, strategies, and styles.

The National Urban League, led by Whitney Young, was a more conservative organization than others like the Congress of Racial Equality. Historically, the Urban League represented more middle-class Black people and was more focused on cooperation and improving Black peoples’ lives through existing systems.[^1] By contrast, the Congress on Racial Equality (or CORE) and other organizations were willing to participate in direct-action protests, like a sit-in at a construction site to demand the hiring of Black workers.[^2] They sought more radical change, as in [Harlem CORE’s proposal for an independent school district in Harlem](/topics/who-governs-schools/community-control/proposal-independent-boe-harlem/).

Nonetheless, the heads of both the National Urban League and CORE agreed that [the Moynihan Report](/gallery/the-controversial-moynihan-report) was an inaccurate and dangerous document.

In his critique of the report, Urban League head Whitney Young outlines the flaws in the report’s reasoning and evidence. Young summarizes, “The problems the Negro family faces today are caused by its economic disadvantages, which are in turn mainly the result of the discrimination and unequal treatment of today – not chiefly the result of slavery, as the report argues.”
