Dayniah Manderson is a teacher at Mott Hall Community School in Throggs Neck in the Bronx. For twelve years, she couldn't use the restroom at her workplace because it was inaccessible to a wheelchair user. In March 2021, after years of asking, she filed a lawsuit to force her school to provide this basic accommodation. As of 2022, about 73% of public schools in New York City are considered accessible. Most of these are only partially accessible, meaning some classrooms, hallways, or bathrooms can not be accessed by people with mobility disabilities.[^1]
