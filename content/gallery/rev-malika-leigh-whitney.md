When she was growing up in Harlem in the 1940s, Reverend Malika Leigh Whitney played a lot of street games, like hopscotch, jacks, stick ball, and stoop ball. But she loved jumping Double Dutch the most.

Today, Reverend Whitney leads Double Dutch Dreamz, a program she founded in Harlem in 2008. Double Dutch Dreamz promotes cooperative learning through games. Participants write Double Dutch rhymes about racism, sexism, and other issues in their community—learning about history and systems of oppression as they move.

The group jumps Double Dutch in public events and at a variety of educational settings. Reverend Whitney hopes to reintegrate this form of play into children’s lives and learning.
