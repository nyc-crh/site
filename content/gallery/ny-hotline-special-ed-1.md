Among New York City students with disability labels today, most are in the category of “learning disability.” This category came into existence in the 1960s, when parent advocates, educators, and psychologists wanted to figure out how to understand students who were struggling with skills like reading or arithmetic, but who did not otherwise seem to have intellectual disabilities.[^1] Dyslexia, for example, is one kind of learning disability.

In New York City, ideas about disability and disability categories have long been connected to ideas about race.[^2] In the 1970s [as shown by this federal investigation](topics/seeking-equity/hew-report), in the 1990s as discussed in the video, and today, Black and Latinx students, and students living in poverty, are more likely to be identified as “learning disabled” than white students and wealthier students.[^3] Many advocates, like the speaker in this video, have been concerned that students are labeled “learning disabled” because the school system is not designed to support them.
