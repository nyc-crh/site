By the 1980s, Audre Lorde was working full-time as a writer. She had published essays and poetry. She had also been fighting cancer, which she was diagnosed with in 1978.

This photograph shows her at work at an office. In these years she was one of the founders of Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press, which was dedicated to publishing Black feminist writings.
