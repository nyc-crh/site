In the East Harlem community control district, teachers emphasized subjects that connected to their students’ African heritage. They also made use of the school’s physical spaces to recognize Black history, including in programs that welcomed members of the community around the school.[^1]

One of these events was a memorial service for Malcolm X, who had lived and worked in Harlem before he was assassinated on February 21, 1965. Held in 1969, this memorial came four years after Malcolm X’s death, and less than a year after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on April 4, 1968. Dr. King had been the subject of many more public celebrations of his life and work, including in schools, than had Malcolm X. At the time, Malcolm X’s views had often been labeled too radical for inclusion in many school curricula.

By hosting the memorial service at I.S. 201, educators were signaling that the school was a resource for community events, and they were recognizing a range of voices, ideas, and strategies in the Black freedom struggle.
