questions:

- Why do the white parents oppose desegregation? What claims do they make about busing and paying taxes? 
- In your opinion, how are the views about integration expressed in these videos similar and different from those expressed by students and parents today?
- How do the ideas expressed here by white students and parents reflect or connect to racist ideas of the time, including those represented in the [Moynihan Report](/topics/how-did-nyc-segregate/racist-ableist-ideas/the-controversial-moynihan-report)?
