In 1970, about one quarter of all New York City public school students were Puerto Rican. And in some parts of the city, like the South Bronx, that proportion was much higher, around 65 percent.[^1] Many Puerto Rican students spoke Spanish at home, but the local public schools operated almost exclusively in English.

United Bronx Parents organized parents in the South Bronx to fight for better schools for their children. UBP director Evelina López Antonetty came to New York from Puerto Rico as a child and later raised her family in the South Bronx. Antonetty presented this report to New York State education officials. In it she criticized New York City schools and explained what steps the schools could take to make education more just for Puerto Rican students.

Testing was one area of concern in the report. Labeling Puerto Rican students as disabled had a long history in New York City. In 1935, the Board of Education sponsored a study of Puerto Rican students at one school in East Harlem. Students were given two kinds of intelligence tests. These tests - as Puerto Rican leaders and their allies pointed out at the time - could not be accurate measures of students’ intelligence. They were given only in English and they included many cultural references that were not familiar to most Puerto Rican students. Nevertheless, the Board of Education and its representatives spoke about the “subnormal Puerto Rican child” and characterized Puerto Rican boys and girls as threats to New York schools and the nation.[^2]

Racist and ableist treatment of Puerto Rican children continued in New York schools, and organizations like United Bronx Parents worked hard to challenge them.
