- According to [its website](https://www.twain239.com/), how does Mark Twain define a good education? Do you agree with that definition? Why or why not?
- Some educators and education advocates argue that New York City should have no “gifted and talented” programs. Others say that there should be more of these programs. What do you think?

Mark Twain opened a “gifted and talented” program for students in District 21, as part of Judge Jack Weinstein’s 1974 desegregation plan. Within two years, the school had garnered a reputation for academic excellence. Today, any student in New York City can apply to attend, and Mark Twain receives many applicants every year. [The school’s enrollment](/gallery/mark-twain-school-performance-dashboard) shows racial segregation - with far fewer Black and Latinx students and far more white and Asian students at the school than the city average or than is proportional to the nearby District 21 community - and fewer Disabled students.

As the Inside Schools review shows, Mark Twain provides significant resources and opportunities for students in academics and various arts areas. Many of the school’s students apply to and are admitted to New York’s specialized high schools – which have in recent years admitted very small numbers of Black and Latinx students and do not have strong supports in place for Disabled students.[^1]
