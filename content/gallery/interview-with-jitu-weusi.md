questions: 
- Based on Weusi’s previous activism and work in education, why do you think he is opposed to mayoral control of schools?
- Weusi sees mayoral control as a “dictatorship,” rather than a democratic organization of schools. Why does he view mayoral control as a “dictatorship”? Do you agree or disagree? Why?
- How do Weusi’s priorities for education differ from those who supported mayoral control like Joel Klein and Michael Bloomberg?
