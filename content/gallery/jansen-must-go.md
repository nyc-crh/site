Harlem residents like Ella Baker and Mae Mallory, alongside other parents and community members in Brooklyn and in Jamaica, Queens, pushed the New York City Board of Education to integrate their schools. They [gathered information about conditions in schools serving Black and Latinx students](/gallery/check-your-school-questionnaire), and conducted “street meetings” where parents and interested community members could talk with each other about their concerns.

Ella Baker was one of the founders of the group Parents In Action Against Educational Discrimination. She was a veteran activist who had worked in Harlem, New York City, and across the South for nearly two decades. But she was not interested in becoming a figurehead or a celebrated public voice of a movement. She wanted to organize in a way that helped everyone learn and develop their own leadership skills.[^1] She said that “strong people don’t need strong leaders.”[^2]  

This flier focuses on Superintendent of Schools William Jansen. Jansen had been in charge of New York’s schools since 1947, and he frequently commented publicly that any patterns of racial segregation in the schools were not the fault of decisions that he or the Board of Education had made. He described New York’s schools as “separated,” but not “segregated.”[^3]  In addition to being a superintendent, Jansen was also the author of textbooks widely used in New York schools. His book *Distant Lands* depicted African civilizations as “very backward” and described colonization as “helping develop the region.” This racist text drew criticism from teachers in the Teachers Union (which included [Lucile Spence](/topics/black-latina-women/lucile-spence)) and parents, who published a 1951 pamphlet called *Bias and Prejudice in Textbooks in the New York City Schools: An Indictment.*[^4]
