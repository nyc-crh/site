In the 1970s and 1980s in New York City, many Black and Latinx neighborhoods were impoverished and their residents were struggling. Some landlords decided they could make more money by burning down their buildings—where people had been living—than by renting them out to individuals and families. This led to many dangerous fires, especially in the South Bronx. Once the fires were put out, they left behind damaged buildings and piles of rubble. Nonetheless, there were families and children living, growing, and playing in these areas.[^1]

Living and working in the Bronx at this time, sculptors John Ahearn and Rigoberto Torres created plaster-cast portraits of Bronx residents. People from their neighborhood, from young children to older people, appear in Ahearn and Torres’ sculptures. The artists hoped to capture who Bronx residents were beyond the stereotypes that others held about the area, and in their regular lives, including moments of joy and tenderness.[^2]

One of Ahearn and Torres’ sculptures featured girls jumping Double Dutch. The sculpture was mounted on a wall in the South Bronx, above a neighborhood playground.
