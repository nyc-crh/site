The Black press provided a space for Black thinkers to challenge ideas that were getting a lot of attention in white newspapers and other media. James Farmer, an accomplished civil rights activist and National Director of the Congress of Racial Equality, used his column in the *Amsterdam News*, New York’s main Black newspaper, to share his critique of the Moynihan Report.

Farmer disputes the specific arguments that the Moynihan Report makes, and he shares his criticisms of what he thinks the report’s results will be.
