Student protesters at City College (CCNY) explained why they organized a strike on their campus and what changes they wanted to achieve.

City College was located in the Black and Puerto Rican neighborhood of Harlem - yet very few Black and Puerto Rican students attended. City College’s admissions policies excluded them. And their curriculum also did not represent the histories and concerns of students of color.

To make the changes demanded in this document, student protesters occupied several buildings on the CCNY campus from April 22, 1969 until the end of the semester. They also organized marches and strikes. The police and some students responded to the student activists with violence. Student protest led to a new open admissions policy in the City University of New York system, providing any student who graduated from high school in New York City with admission to a two- or four-year college.[^1]
