- Who does Mark Twain serve?
- How has the decision to make Mark Twain a "gifted and talented" school shaped the student population at Mark Twain? 
- How do you think “selective admission” schools like Mark Twain and the specialized high schools contribute to segregation throughout the city? Do you think New York City should have “selective admission” schools? Why or why not?

As a “gifted and talented” school, Mark Twain accepts applicants from all over the city. This report from the NYC Department of Education describes who attends Mark Twain and how students who attend do on standardized tests.

Some of the data compares Mark Twain’s student population to the city’s population of students living in poverty, for example, or students learning English.

New York City today has several other schools that operate similarly. Students from all over the city can take tests for admissions to these “specialized high schools,” like Stuyvesant and Bronx Science. These schools today have a very small population of Black and Latinx students.[^1]

Would you describe Mark Twain today as a segregated school? Why or why not?
