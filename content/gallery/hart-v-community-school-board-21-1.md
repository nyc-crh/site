questions: 
- According to Judge Weinstein, what decisions did the school board make that led to segregation in District 21 and at Mark Twain?
- How does “underutilizing” or “overutilizing” a school space impact students’ experiences in a school?
- What do you notice about how Judge Weinstein speaks about students and schools in this excerpt? Why do you think that Judge Weinstein uses the term “racial imbalance” interchangeably with segregation? What does that term illuminate? What does it hide?
- If you were fighting for educational equity, like Jeffrey Hart’s mother Doris Hart, would you focus on school segregation like she did? 
- How does the last paragraph of the excerpt help us understand *why* the school district encouraged segregation at Mark Twain?
