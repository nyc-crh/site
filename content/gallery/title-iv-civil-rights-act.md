Signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on June 2, 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination based on race, religion, sex, and national origin. The Act banned segregation in public places, including schools, parks, theaters, and hotels, and it denied the use of federal funds for any program that practiced segregation. The Act even authorized the Office of Education to assist in facilitating school desegregation.

The first version of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was introduced by President John F. Kennedy in June 1963. After President Kennedy’s assisination, President Johnson successfully advocated to pass the legislation. Although President Johnson played a key role in pushing the bill through Congress amidst southern opposition, as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. made clear in January 1964, “the civil rights legislation now before Congress . . . was born in the streets of Birmingham amid snarling dogs and the battering of fire hoses. It was fashioned in the jail cells of the South and by the marching feet in the North.”[^1] Its passage was the result of decades of organizing and activism that sought justice and equality.

However, the full demands of the activists did not make it all the way through the legislative process. President Johnson signed a watered-down version of the original bill. Both northern and southern politicians scaled back what the law required, especially related to the desegregation of public schools.

Emanuel Celler, a US Congressman from Brooklyn, NY, played a critical role in revising the text of the legislation and pushing it through the House of Representatives. Congressman Celler and colleagues added an “antibusing” amendment that said that school systems could not move students from one school to another to desegregate. Second, Congressman Celler helped limit desegregation to the South, where formal laws had Black and white students at separate schools. What Celler and others called “racial imbalance,” where schools were often all Black or all white because of school zoning and racist housing policies, would not require desegregation.[^2]

Congressman Celler and other northern politicians were aware of white resistance to school desegregation. Indeed, shortly after the Senate opened debate on the Civil Rights Act, the Parents and Taxpayers march brought 15,000 white mothers in New York City to the streets to [protest attempts at desegregation](/gallery/parents-and-taxpayers-march). Thus, the political activism of white parents in the North and northern politicians in Congress together helped maintain segregation in northern schools, including in New York City.
