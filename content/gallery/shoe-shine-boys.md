In late 1963, *The Amsterdam News* reported on allegations that teachers and administrators at P.S. 614 in Brooklyn, one of the city’s “600” schools. The teachers being investigated allegedly pocketed over 40,000 subway tokens meant for students. Instead of handing the tokens out, students were forced to perform menial tasks like washing cars or shining shoes to earn the tokens back. Not only were students being mistreated, they were being denied education. The school's principal and administrators didn't offer any information at the time but were later reassigned to a different school.

Paul Zuber, an attorney who helped bring segregation and poor conditions at the “600” schools to light, also represented [Mae Mallory and other parents in the Harlem Nine boycott](/topics/black-latina-women/harlem-nine/).
