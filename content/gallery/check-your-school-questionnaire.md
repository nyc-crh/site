eventname: NAACP distributes a questionnaire to Black and Puerto Rican families about school segregation.
caption: This is a copy of the questionnaire the NAACP distributed to Black and Puerto Rican families to document the conditions within their segregated schools in the 1950s. It is possible that some students collaborated with their parents to complete these forms, as they had knowledge of their schools. This data was then used to compare conditions in these schools to the segregated white schools throughout the city.

Ella Baker was an influential organizer in New York City struggles against segregated schools, police brutality, voting restrictions, and more. She pushed for freedom. Baker saw the pursuit of liberation as a collective effort, and she valued the views and passions of young people. As historian Barbara Ransby put it in her biography on Ella Baker, Baker believed “people had many of the answers within themselves; teachers and leaders simply had to facilitate the process of tapping and framing that knowledge, of drawing it out...Baker’s pedagogy was democratic and reciprocal...her view of teaching for liberation was based on the need to empower ordinary people to dig within themselves and their collective experiences for the answers to social and political questions. She did not want her students to see her as the repository of all knowledge but to discover their own insights and knowledge base.”[^1]

Ella Baker, who moved to New York after graduating from Shaw University in North Carolina, became deeply involved in the struggle to desegregate New York City’s schools.[^2] In line with her view of movement building and democratic action, she worked with parents and young people to define their goals and work together for change. This questionnaire distributed to parents and students to use with their own schools reflects that commitment to grassroots activism based on the knowledge of young people and families. It illustrates Baker’s organizing philosophy in practice.
