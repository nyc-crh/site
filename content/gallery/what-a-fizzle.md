Here a black newspaper, the *Amsterdam News*, reflects on how others spoke about the February 3 boycott both before and after it happened. They comment on how a white newspaper, the New York *Herald Tribune*, had covered the boycott. Other white newspapers, including *The New York Times*, had been very critical of the boycott before it happened.
