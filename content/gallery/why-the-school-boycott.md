The flier designed by two Queens civil rights organizing groups - the Congress of Racial Equality and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People -  calls for a boycott to protest segregation in New York City's public schools.

Boycotting was a dramatic and disruptive move, so the organizers had to explain to people why it was needed. Queens CORE and the Jamaica NAACP argue for why a boycott will make a strong moral, and financial, impact.

You might notice that the text mentions some neighborhoods in Queens - Kew Gardens and South Jamaica - as examples. Segregation was a reality all over New York City, but the authors of this flier were focused on Queens, so they used examples that would be close-to-home and familiar to their readers. Kew Gardens was a segregated white area at the time, while South Jamaica was a segregated Black area.
