questions: 
- How do the voices captured in this podcast compare to the ideas that you heard from Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Jitu Weusi, and Chancellor Joel Klein? 
- How does the podcastâ€™s discussion of charter schools and district schools compare to your own experience as a student in either or both? 
- A key result of mayoral control in New York City was the expansion of charter schools. Does that leave you supporting, or opposing, mayoral control? 
- The Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood in Brooklyn has been home to many phases of Black and Latinx educational activism. If you were to travel back in time and bring some of the [community control activists of the 1960s](/topics/who-governs-schools/community-control/) into Bedford-Stuyvesant today, what would they think?
