eventname: A photographer captures children in a NYC public school. 
caption: Photographer Florence Maynard captured New York City public school students at a time when the city’s schools served many thousands of students who had recently immigrated from Europe, the Caribbean, and other parts of the world. These students were lined up to receive a “commendation,” or award, from their principal.

questions: 
- Based on what you know about who was attending school in New York at this time, who were these students likely to be? Where might have they come from, and why?  What do you think going to school meant to them? What kind of schooling were they hoping for? 
- The article published with this photograph was written by the principal of a Brooklyn school. It included the argument that parents shouldn’t be involved in schools because they had little to contribute. Why do you think the principal felt that way? How would that attitude relate to school governance?
