As part of the New Deal, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the National Housing Act of 1934. Many Americans were living in unsafe or low-quality housing, while the economic downturn caused by the Great Depression threatened the banking and construction industries. Congress passed the National Housing Act to “encourage improvement in housing standards and conditions, to provide a system of mutual mortgage [or home loan] insurance, and for other purposes.”[^1] Lawmakers hoped to reinvigorate the banking industry and encourage banks to make more housing loans by guaranteeing that home loans, or mortgages, would be paid back. If potential homeowners could no longer afford their mortgage payments, the federal government agreed to pay the remaining principal balance.

However, the federal government’s willingness to insure mortgages came with restrictions. Building on the previous work of the [Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC)](/gallery/holc-map), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) conducted its own appraisals of properties, which included a “whites-only” requirement. The FHA refused to insure mortgages for properties in racially mixed neighborhoods and even some white neighborhoods bordering Black residential areas because of the possibility of integration.[^2] By 1938, the FHA guidelines made it clear that in their view only racially segregated neighborhoods, with all residents of the same economic class, should receive mortgages.

Like the HOLC maps, the FHA guidelines funneled government resources to segregated white communities, particularly new suburbs, while keeping resources away from low-income, racially diverse, and predominantly Black central-city neighborhoods. It is hard to fully quantify the impact of these policies on producing segregation. What is clear is that between 1934 and 1968 (when Congress passed the Fair Housing Act) over 98 percent of federally-backed home mortgages went to white people.[^3]
