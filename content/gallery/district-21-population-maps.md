questions: 
- What do you notice about the district’s student population?
- What do you notice about the placement of schools within District 21?
- If you wanted to make Mark Twain a desegregated school, with an enrollment that aligned more with the population of District 21, how would you re-draw the zone lines? 
- How does a map like this demonstrate that segregation was the result of intentional actions and not a natural occurrence?
