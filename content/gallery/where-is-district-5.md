questions: 
- How had Reverend Lucas been involved in education in Harlem? 
- Rev. Lucas named several problems with how Harlem’s Community School District 5 was operating under decentralization. Do you think these are problems that suggest ending, or keeping but reforming, decentralization? 
- Reverend Lucas closes with a comment about Harlem residents not valuing education. Based on evidence from other documents on this site, do you agree with his point?

Under decentralized school governance, each community school district had its own school board, and members of that board were elected by parents and voters who lived within the community school district’s boundaries. (It’s important to specify parents *and* voters because parents who were not citizens, and therefore could not vote in most elections, could vote in community school board elections where their children attended school.)

There were 32 community school districts. The Bronx, for example, was divided into 6 school districts. All of Staten Island remained one district, Community School District 31. Community school district enrollments ranged from roughly 15,000 to 35,000 students, making them much larger than the average US school district, although each was only a small part of the nearly one million-student NYC public school system.[^1]
Community School District 5 covered most of Central and West Harlem above 125th Street. It included the area that had been previously part of the community control district in East Harlem as well.

Harlem’s Community School District 5 struggled soon after its creation. One board member was convicted of illegal use of campaign funds in 1973. In 1976, the chancellor used his power to suspend the elected board members, after a few years of very high turnover in the superintendent job and other signs that the board was not functioning effectively.[^2] 

The problems in Community School District 5 were in some ways only a more extreme version of challenges that many decentralized school districts faced. Voter turnout was very low across the city, as Rev. Lucas notices here, and low turnout meant that small groups, including at times teachers and other people working in the schools, rather than the parents and community members that decentralization had wanted to empower, could influence elections. District 5 and others also had school board members accused of corruption, and in some cases, as in Community School District 12 in the Bronx, there was evidence to support these accusations. Rev. Lucas addresses some of those concerns in his letter. Yet there were also districts that created innovative and successful new programs, as in Community School District 7’s new bilingual education program, and the small elementary and middle schools of choice in District 4.[^3]
