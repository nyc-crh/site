questions: 
- How had Reverend Lucas been involved in education in Harlem? 
- Rev. Lucas named several problems with how Harlem’s Community School District 5 was operating under decentralization. Do you think these are problems that suggest ending, or keeping but reforming, decentralization? 
- Reverend Lucas closes with a comment about Harlem residents not valuing education. Based on evidence from other documents on this site, do you agree with his point?
