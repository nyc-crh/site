Benjamin Franklin High School students came together in clubs that celebrated their cultural identities, like Club Borinquen and clubs focused on Italian American culture. And they worked together on projects to make change in the world, as when they gathered resources to help in the effort to win World War II.

But they also took on projects that sought and in some cases won major change in their very local community in East Harlem.

East Harlem housing was crowded, and often the buildings were in poor repair after decades of heavy use and insufficient repair. Students recognized this problem and began to document it via community study. They conducted surveys, drew maps, and talked with local politicians. In the 1930s and 1940s, programs that were part of the federal New Deal created new opportunities for cities to build public housing. Students organized rallies and put pressure on their local congressman to support new public housing for East Harlem. And he did. Public housing built in the area provided better ventilation, more light, and often more room than previous tenement apartments.[^1]
