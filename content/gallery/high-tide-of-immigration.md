eventname: A political cartoon captures anti-immigrant attitudes.
caption: This is a political cartoon published in 1903 during the Progressive Era, when immigration accounted for much of the new population growth in New York City. Many immigrants came from Europe by boat in search of economic and social opportunities spanning decades. This document clearly targeted the cityâ€™s local white audience by presenting strong anti-immigration, white supremacist, and American patriotic rhetoric, each as socially acceptable ideas.

questions: 
- What do you think the message of this political cartoon is? Who do you think it is trying to speak to? 
- What idea of the United States does this political cartoon communicate? What relationship does it suggest between US patriotism and immigration? 
- How could the anti-immigrant or xenophobic sentiment depicted in this cartoon have mattered for school governance in New York City? How could it affect how people thought about who should be in charge of a system with a large majority of immigrant students and a predominantly white and Protestant Christian political elite?
