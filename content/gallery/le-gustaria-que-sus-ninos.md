Like many Puerto Rican parents in the South Bronx, Evelina López Antonetty was frustrated that so many Spanish-speaking children were not learning to read. Many were being placed in classes intended for students with disabilities because they spoke Spanish. “I began to see the schools as an island,” Antonetty recalled, “After 3 o’clock, the school officials closed the doors and left the community. They made no input into the community. There were no teachers in the school from the community.”[^1]

Antonetty’s organizing work led to the founding of United Bronx Parents in 1965. The organization’s early focus was on bilingual education because so many of the neighborhood youth came from Spanish-speaking families, and the Board of Education failed to provide the education they deserved and needed. Antonetty did not decide alone what UBP would work on or what goals they would pursue. Instead, the organization helped prepare parents to demand improvement in their schools, based on parents’ knowledge and hopes for their children.[^2] In this way, Antonetty’s approach was similar to that of other [earlier organizers like Ella Baker](https://nyccivilrightshistory.org/site-preview/topics/boycotting-ny-schools/youth-organizing/check-your-school-questionnaire).
