Schools in Ocean Hill-Brownsville’s community control district stuck to some old traditions, like having a guest speaker at graduation. I.S. 55, which was one of the schools in the district, welcomed poet, educator, and theorist June Jordan to give their spring 1970 graduation speech.[^1]

In her remarks, Jordan commented on large themes of life, truth, freedom, and community. She spoke of withdrawing from politics - which was connected to “the old power,” rather than to new imaginings of how communities could live together and educate their children.
