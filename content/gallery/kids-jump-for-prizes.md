The Eighth Annual World International Double Dutch competition took place at Lincoln Center in 1981. It had grown dramatically since two New York City police officers began the tournament in 1974.

There were thousands of participants and fans from all over New York City and surrounding states, including New York City Mayor Ed Koch. Large corporations like McDonalds and Mobile Oil provided funding for the tournament. The *Amsterdam News* described the day in both photographs and an article.
