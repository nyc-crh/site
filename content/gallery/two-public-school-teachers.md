In March 1925, [*The Survey Graphic* published a special issue](https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll336:2133). The national magazine with a predominantly white readership invited Alain Locke to guest-edit the issue. He wrote that the issue was meant “to document the New Negro culturally and socially,—to register the transformations of the inner and outer life of the Negro in America that have so significantly taken place in the last few years.” The issue explored the origins of jazz and “Negro folk music,” the “inner life of Harlem,” the community’s “organizing social forces,” the neighborhood’s youth, and the conditions of the schools they attended.[^1]  

The [March 1925 *Survey Graphic*](https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll336:2133) was not just an analysis of “the New Negro.” It was also an important statement about how Black Harlemites understood themselves and wanted the world to understand them. As Alain Locke made clear, so much public discussion “...is about the Negro rather than of him, so that it is the Negro problem rather than the Negro that is known.” Locke and other contributors made the [*Survey Graphic* special issue](https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll336:2133) an act of “self-portraiture” that “concentrated upon self-expression and the forces and motives of self-determination.”[^2] Part of that “self-portraiture” was in the term “New Negro” itself, which Alain Locke used to declare a new phase of African American life and leadership that was confident, conscious, capable, and ready to contest the misperceptions of others.

The [*Survey Graphic* issue](https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll336:2133) included several portraits by German immigrant artist Winhold Reiss. This one captures “Two Public School Teachers,” likely Lucile Spence and Melva Price.[^3] These two teachers advocated for Black history, school integration, improved educational facilities, and more. They saw their role as educators to go beyond teaching core subjects, to include working with their communities for better schooling and a better world.

Given the [*Survey Graphic* issue](https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/item/p16022coll336:2133)’s focus on “self expression” and the “motives of self-determination,” this portrait raises interesting questions about how these activist educators chose to present themselves and why they made those choices.
