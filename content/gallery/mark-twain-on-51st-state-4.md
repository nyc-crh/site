questions: 
- Why do you think Dr. Kenneth Clark labeled the plan “obscene, immoral, illegal, and unconstitutional?” Do you agree with his assessment?
- What does Berger mean when he says that his plan is “the only plan that can succeed?” Whose preferences did Berger have in mind? 
- How does the decision to turn Mark Twain into a magnet school illustrate who has power and how power works within the New York City school system? What has changed, or stayed the same, since the 1974 desegregation case at Mark Twain?
