The Black Panther Party’s Harlem Branch, founded in 1966, defined Black Power as “having the right to self-determination or the power to decide what should go down in our community,” and “being the decision makers, the policy makers.”[^1]

Harlem’s Black Panther Party emphasized self-determination in education, as you can see in this letter announcing the party and its planned protest about education in the neighborhood.
