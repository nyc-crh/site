In the late 1800s through the early 1900s, educators and social reformers created institutions for people they called “idiots,” “feeble minded,” or later, “mentally retarded.”[^1] They said that these facilities could train children and return them to society as productive citizens, and relieve the few overcrowded and understaffed “special classes” in city schools. State institutions like Letchworth Village were built to take on the responsibility of educating children outside of New York City.

Over time, and with less funding and greater demand, institutions opened throughout the country. New York State had the highest concentration of these institutions. In October 1947, Willowbrook State School opened as the largest state institution of its kind in the United States. It was run by the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene.

The parents of children who were sent to institutions were often told by their physicians that an institution was the best place for their child. Families with greater financial means could choose to care for their disabled children at home rather than send them to an institution.
