Welcome to the New York City Civil Rights History Project!

# Please Read and Acknowledge the Following

Histories of oppression, exclusion, segregation, ableism, and racism are often left out of the curriculum. The materials and lessons on this site explore these issues in an open and direct way.Cultural attitudes and language have evolved.  We use the language that communities have chosen to describe themselves today. However, some of the selected historical documents include terms that are offensive today. There may also be images and videos that are emotionally upsetting.

For educators, we ask that you acknowledge these difficulties and make space for the emotional responses that they may provoke. Understand the potential for some students to react in disrespectful ways to these topics. Be intentional in reviewing the lessons you choose, assess students’ maturity and readiness, and establish clear parameters that will ensure safe and constructive dialogue. [Resources to prepare you for creating a safe learning community.](/teaching-resources/safe-learning-community)

For students, we ask that you consider how you and your peers' identify as a disabled or nondisabled, and/or how you and your peers’ racial identities may change your emotional reaction to these materials.
