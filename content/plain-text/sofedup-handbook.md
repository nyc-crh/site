non-disabled individuals, in a united effort for activism, in order to secure the
inalienable rights that are essential for the disabled to function as independently
as possible.
There have been isolated accomplishments and achievements across this
nation, on the part of brave and persistent individuals and progressive and highly
committed organizations, that are praised and set up as models of inspiration for
the disabled, to work harder, achieve more, and strive to surmount above average
obstacles in pursuing their goals. They have had their affect upon us. They have
succeeded in their efforts. They have fulfilled their purposes. They have influenced
us to become better motivated, better trained, better educated, and
because of this, better people.
But what happens to us now that we have worked to become this way?
When we attempt to seek higher' education, we are, forced to select a school
according to its architectural accessibility, rather than if its degree program, and
academic accredidation meet the standards of our individual professional and
educational goals, or achievement caliber. When we go to look for a job, to put
what we have been educated and trained for into operation, are we judged for
the job on an equal basis as our non-disabled peers? When we do get a job, can
we support ourselves, or our families, on the salary we earn after the exhorbitant
expenses for transportation to and from work are deducted from our paychecks
(since we cannot use what is ;;ublicly provided for all)? When we can support
ourselves comfortably in a nice apartment, are we able to live where we want, if
we can't get through a door that is not wide enough to enter the building or get
into the bathroom?
What then happens to our motivation? Are we to be teased by lucrative
pmgrams and independent efforts that are dangled in front of us and give us the
incentive to work harder and to try to build a better life for ourselves, only to
find, blocking our way, what appears to be insurmountable obstacles that are
created by the apathy of bureaucratic administrators and the selfish unconcern
of Our own people, who feel they have made it and do not concern themselves
with the problems of their fellow men?
The reason I am presenting these rhetorical questions, is to make you
realize that individual, or isolated accomplishments are not truly complete if the
overall society and structure are not affected by it, and still remain apathetic to
the needs of the masses.

The policy of inspiration must now be replaced by a policy of activism. We
must expand and fulfill our rehabilitation methodology to include a concern as
to what happens to the disabled person after he is trained or motivated to the
specific standards of a program where success is based solely on his securing
remunerative employment.
We must make the hierarchy of education aware of the necessity to
abandon the psychology that forces an institutionalized alienation of disabled
individuals into isolated specific programs and classes for the handicapped only,
and instead, make all schools and colleges architecturally accessible and bureaucratically
non-inhibitive for the disabled so that they, and the non-disabled can
interact with each other.
The disabled must have the same opportunity to attend any college of
their choice as the non-disabled. They should not have to compromise their
professional and educational goals because architectural barriers prevent them
from gaining access to the school of their choice.
We must end the blatant discrimination that employers and administrators
have for the disabled, by forcing Federal, State and Municipal intervention and
legislation to protect our rights. And equally important and necessary, we must
educate them to the fact that the disabled are capable of many qualities that will
outweigh their physical limitations, so that they, as employers, will be able to
judge us as prospective employees, free from the bigotry of the social stigmas
attached to the disabled, which are not valid or fair.
We must make the individual and the independent organizations for the
physically disabled, aware of the necessity to join together as an activist nationally
collated force united in their efforts to bring down the walls of apathy,
oppression, and discrimination.
We must make the disabled individual aware of the fact that only he, as a
single entity of such a force, is the kinetic energy responsible for giving it the
power to work. And, I say "Disabled Individual", rather than Handicapped
because handicapped is the terminology favored by those who, through their
ameliorative efforts and tedious apathy, create or strengthen those, until now,
insurmountable walls that are the obstacles and barriers responsible for handicapping
us. Until now, I say, because we are tired of these walls being taken
apart by the tedious brick by brick process as practiced by those, who can do no
more, but only dole out. to us concessions and conciliations in the name of
charity and ameliorative programs to placate theirown consciences.
The lack of ramps, elevators and lavatory facilities that are accessible and
properly equipped, presents insurmountable barriers to the physically disabled.
We, the members of S.O. F.E.D. U.P. have succeeded at Brooklyn College in
eliminating these inhibiting factors that deny the physically disabled the freedoms
of independent performance in an atmosphere conducive to learning and
understanding. However, what we have accomplished is but a foundation for
what is to follow, as determined only by you, yourselves. It is your responsibility,
as well as mine, to add to what we have begun for you, by utilizing what
experiences and knowledge you gain at Brooklyn College,"and actively adapt it
to the overall community. Until all facilities, be they public, private, university,
business or housing, are completely accessible to the disabled, society is guilty of
handicapping us in our efforts to achieve our rights. Until we, the disabled, begin
to become future, as well as now oriented, in our thinking, we will continue to
be as much a handicapping factor ourselves, as the intolerance and apathy of our
institutions. The key for success, status, and recognition in our society is education.
Therefore, we as students, who are physically disabled, must be realistic
about our situation when choosing a college. Of course, until universal renovation
is a reality, we must choose a college that is physically accessible to
us-but equally as important and critical is the vital necessity for us to choose a
highly accredited institution that will compliment cur own academic qualifications
and goals, so that the coupling of these two variables will afford us the
maximum credentials possible for graduate school acceptance and professional
placement.
This is essentially what we are offering you at Brooklyn College-an investment
in your future. -

Founder, and First
President of
S.O. F.E.D. U.P.
Part 1
Student Organization For Every Disability United for Progress
HISTORY
S.O. F.E.D. U.P. was founded during thl Fall semester of 1970 by
Frederick L. Francis, and Arthur Lefkin, Lel disabled students, because they
recognized the tremendous need for a united effort for activism on the part of
the disabled of Brooklyn College, in order to eliminate the architectural barriers,
and those curricular and bureaucratic procedures which inhibited their educational
performance and initiative.
Our initial role was to act as a collective agent for the disabled. However, it
was not too long before we were forced, out of necessity, to assume the role of a
"pressure group", in order to secure our demands and recommendations made to
the administration, because of their tedious apathy in response to them. As a
result of our efforts, we were able to meet with President John Kneller, and
successfully secure definite commitments on his part to make Brooklyn College
architecturally accessible to the disabled; and to establish a "Dean's Committee
on the Disabled", made up of various college Deans, faculty, and disabled
student leaders, whose purpose would be to act as an implementing board in the
various critical areas of admissions, curricular planning, campus facilities and
counseling. We had also secured, from President Kneller, the assurance that the
newly constructed additions to the present campus would be completely acces
sible to the disabled student.
Within a month these commitments were fulfilled, and S.O. F.E.D. U.P.
then began to make the administrators of the college aware of the necessity to
provide various support services, needed for all types of disabilities; and began to
escalate their important role of providing social, educational and recreational
activities for the disabled and non-disabled members of the college community.
PHILOSOPHY
In general, we emphatically state that what we have accomplished and
tend to build on the Brooklyn College Campus is not an isolated "c, liege
ghetto" for the disabled in City University, nor do we have, or will we ever
become a health conservation college program. What we highly endorse is the
interaction between disabled and non-disabled individuals in an integrated community
for the purpose of attaining a better understanding of each other based
upon who they are as individuals...not what their disabilities or limitations...
brand them as.
4
We firmly believe that there is a critical need for a shift in the consciousness
and awareness of the disabled from being. influenced and dictated to by
others who are domineering and overprotective, to seeking a more active role in
determining what directly affects them.
It is an immediate priority in order to attain this position that the disabled
must secure what is necessary for them to function as independently as possible
to the best of their capabilities.
It is through this self-reliant, self-determinant and activist philosophy that
the disabled will be able to find his identity as an individual and an active
member of a group respected because of its accomplishments. This above all else
will enable him to earn the security and self respect of knowing that, though he
may not be able to physically pet form in the conventional manner, he is still
accomplishing the task as an independent individual and is a contributing
member of his community.
PURPOSE
It is the intention of S.O. F.E.D. U.P., as a chartered organization, through
the Department of Student Activities to
*Provide social and recreational activities for the heterogeneous group of
disabled and non-disabled student and faculty members of S.O. F.E.D.
U.P. on the Brooklyn College campus in an atmosphere where they can
encounter each other as respected individuals.
*To retain our initial role as a collective agent representing the disabled
members of the Brooklyn College community on matters pertaining to
architectural, bureaucratic and curricular barriers that exist as inhibitive
and hazardous factors affecting the performance of the disabled on the
Brooklyn College campus.
To educate and create learning experiences for the disabled and nondisabled
members of the Brooklyn College community where they will be
able to judge each other as individuals, with their own selective person.
alities, motivations, and make-up in order to break down the unfair and
disproved social and psychological stigmas that exist about the disabled.
*It is our belief that the disabled are a minority group that has been, and is
being, blatantly exploited and discriminated against. Therefore, it is a
purpose of S.O. F.E.D. U.P. to become actively involved in educating its
members to become more informed of the overall conditions of our
society which affect them and will continue to affect them after they
leave Brooklyn College.
