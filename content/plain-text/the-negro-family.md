## The Negro Family: A Case for National Action (excerpt)

March 1965

### Introduction

First... the racist virus in the American blood stream still afflicts us: Negroes will encounter serious personal prejudice for at least another generation. Second, three centuries of sometimes unimaginable mistreatment have taken their toll on the Negro people. The harsh fact is that as a group, at the present time, in terms of ability to win out in the competitions of American life, they are not equal to most of those groups with which they will be competing. Individually, Negro Americans reach the highest peaks of achievement. But collectively, in the spectrum of American ethnic and religious and regional groups, where some get plenty and some get none, where some send eighty percent of their children to college and others pull them out of school at the 8th grade, Negroes are among the weakest.

The most difficult fact for white Americans to understand is that in these terms the circumstances of the Negro American community in recent years has probably been getting worse, not better.

… The gap between the Negro and most other groups in American society is widening.

### Chapter 2, The Negro American Family

At the heart of the deterioration of the fabric of Negro society is the deterioration of the Negro family.

It is the fundamental source of weakness of the Negro community at the present time.

*… The white family has achieved a high degree of stability and is maintaining that stability.*

*By contrast, the family structure of lower class Negroes is highly unstable, and in many urban centers is approaching complete breakdown.*

…
Nearly a quarter of urban Negro marriages are dissolved.
….

Nearly one-quarter of Negro births are now illegitimate.
…

Almost one-fourth of Negro families are headed by females
…

*The breakdown of the Negro Family Has Led to a Startling Increase in Welfare Dependency.*

The majority of Negro children receive public assistance under \[welfare programs\] at one point or another in their childhood.

### Chapter 4, The Tangle of Pathology

In a word, most Negro youth are in danger of being caught up in the tangle of pathology that affects their world, and probably a majority are so entrapped.

### Chapter 5, The Case for National Action

Three centuries of injustice have brought about deep­seated structural distortions in the life of the Negro American. At this point, the present tangle of pathology is capable of perpetuating itself without assistance from the white world. The cycle can be broken only if these distortions are set right.

In a word, a national effort towards the problems of Negro Americans must be directed towards the question of family structure. The object should be to strengthen the Negro family so as to enable it to raise and support its members as do other families. After that, how this group of Americans chooses to run its affairs, take advantage of its opportunities, or fail to do so, is none of the nation's business.
