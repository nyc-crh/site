A series of 20 incomplete drawings. The test taker is supposed to complete the picture. It becomes harder to spot the missing parts as the drawings progress from 1-20. The first few drawings are obvious, with three faces missing a mouth, eyes, and nose, and a person with their hand raised to eat soup with no spoon. There is also a house with an incomplete chimney, a rabbit missing an ear, a bulb without a filament, a letter without a stamp, a violin with no strings, a crab missing a leg, a cat missing its shadow, and a woman's incomplete reflection. The missing parts of the other images are difficult to find.

The second page from the study shows results, a ruler with numbers for different nationalities ranked in order. The left side of the ruler is labeled "Combined Scale" and the right side is labeled "Mental Age." From low to high, the combined scale numbers are:
