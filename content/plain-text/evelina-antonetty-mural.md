"We will never stop struggling here in The Bronx, even though they've destroyed it around us. We would pitch tents if we had to rather than move from here. We would fight back, there is nothing we would not do. They will never take us away from here. I feel very much a part of this and I'm never going to leave, and, after me, my children will be here to carry on. I have very strong children and very strong grandchildren."
