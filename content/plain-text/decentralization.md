DECENTRALIZATION: Will mean that locally appointed or elected
LOCAL CONTROL:
boards will have limited powers over the
selection of personnel, allocation of budget~
adaptation of curriculum, and deployment of staff.
' BUT IT WILL ALSO MEAN THAT THE CENTRAL HEADQUARTERS
will continue to have SUBSTANTIALP OWER.S. They
will be able to remove any governing board, even if
it is chosen by the community. They will still
decide on teacher and supervisory "qualifit!ations"
and examinations. They will negotiate the contracts
with the UFT, with the Supervisory union, and with
the custodians. They will have final powers over
budget, deciding how much each district should get.
They will still control school construction.
1. Districts will define their own boundaries.
2. Districts will elect their c)wn representatives.

of its powers to the local district. The local
district ivill then be responsible· DIRECTI;.,Yto

on tl1e local district. (This is what happens
in the suburban communities.)
4. Money will be given to -each district EQUALLY
on a per capita basis. The sa.me amount of
dollars will be budgeted for each child. (For
a city budget of a billion dollars and a million

SPEND THAT MONEY.
