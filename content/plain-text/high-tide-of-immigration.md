A cartoon of Uncle Sam towering over the American shoreline, flag in hand looking down at the ocean. "Danger to American Ideas and Institutions" is engraved on the mountain he leans against. The heads of dozens of immigrants float above the water, some with words like "criminal, mafia, outlaw, illeterate, pauper, and anarchist" on their hats. The words "Riff Raff Immigration" are spelled out on the waves. 

Original caption: The High Tide of Immigrationâ€”A National Menace. Immigration statistics for the past yer show that the influx of foreigners was the greatest in our history, and also that the hard-working peasants are now being supplanted by the criminals and outlaws of all Europe.
