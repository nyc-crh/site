DO NOT SIGN PETITIONS or STATEMENTS of ANY KIND

Pullman Porters and Maids

**ATTENTION!**

INTIMIDATION, COERCION, THREATS and FORCE were used in order to get porters and maids to vote in this election just closed. And now they are being insulted by certian "Stool Pigeons", who are submitting the "YELLOW DOG CONTRACT" to you to sign, under the guise of a LOYALTY PETITION

You Are Not Disloyal If You Do Not Sign This Statement Or Petition

Attend A Special Series of Meeting to be held by the CHICAGO DIVISION of BROTHERHOOD of SLEEPING CAR PORTERS at the Headquarters, 224 East 39th Street on the following dates: Monday, November 14; Tuesday, November 15; Wednesday, November 16; Thursday, November 17; Friday, November 18, and Saturday, November 19, at 8:30 P.M.

The origination of this so-called LOYALTY CONTRACT and the methods used to bring it out will be revealed in detail at these meeting$, as well as the subtle plans for holding another conference in a last desperate effort of the Company to defeat the Brotherhood.

Come out and get this information as well as the facts about the success of the Brotherhood's Case which the "Stools" are desperately trying to discredit.

EVERY BONA FIDE PULLMAN PORTER AND MAID IS WELCOME AT THESE MEETINGS.

We will also reveal the desperate efforts made by the Company to stop the Brotherhood's Mass Meeting two weeks ago.

This Progressive Organization is steadily marching forward and the ravings of a few derelict "Stool Pigeons" cannot stop the onward march of the Pullman Porters toward a living wage and decent working  conditions.

Read this CIRCULAR and pass it on to another PORTER.
