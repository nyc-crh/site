Jansen *Must* Go!

Dr. William Jansen, superintendent of schools has failed the new Negro and Puerto Rican children of the city of New York. He has failed to provide experienced teachers for our schools. Failed to change the zoning laws lines to promote integration. Failed to plan new schools to avoid double sessions. Failed to provide special guidance for pupils who need it most. Failed to act on integration reports.

Dr. Jansen does not have the will or the vision to do the job. He will be 70 years old in October. Our children can not wait until ju June, 1958. He should be retired now.
