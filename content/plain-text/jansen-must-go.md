Jansen *Must* Go!

Dr. William Jansen, superintendent of schools has **failed** the new Negro and Puerto Rican children of the City of New York. He has

- **Failed** to provide experienced teachers for our schools.
- **Failed** to change the zoning laws lines to promote integration.
- **Failed** to plan new schools to avoid double sessions.
- **Failed** to provide special guidance for pupils who need it most.
- **Failed** to act on integration reports.

Dr. Jansen **does not have the will or the vision to do the job.** He will be 70 years old in October. Our children can not wait until June, 1958. **He should be retired now!**
