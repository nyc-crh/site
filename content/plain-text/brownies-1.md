## Little people of the month

A musician

Most boys and girls are frightened when they get up to "speak a piece" at the Sunday School concert. But Eugene Mars Martin would not be, because he has been used to facing audiences ever since he was very tiny. When he was not quite four years old, he played on his little violin in the auditorium of the Grand Central Palace, in New York. Since then he has studied at the Institute of Musical Art, in New York, and also under Edwin Coates for piano and Conrad C. Held for the violin. Last year he appeared in Aeolian Hall, one of the finest musical auditoriums in the country. That was his coming-out concert. 

Hasn't he had an interesting life in his 15 years? And best of all, he is the champion pitcher on the Neighborhood's Baseball Team. 

## A shining example

Wouldn't it be wonderful if every child who reads the Brownies' Book should have a record like that of Lucile Spence? She came from South Carolina to New York City and has lived there eight years. When she graduated from the grammar school, out of a class of 150, she received the gold medal for the highest average in general excellence. But this was only the beginning of Lucile's career. She went to the Wadleigh High School and there in her second year, as a result of a fine composition, she became a member of the "Scribes," a literary club, which usually receives only third and fourth year pupils. Later she became a member of the Arista, a club whose members Excel in scholarship and character, and also of a classical club, the Helennes. Lucile wrote a number of short stories, which were published in the *Owl*, the school magazine; then she wrote and helped produce the first play ever given in Wadleigh, which had a colored theme and was produced by colored students. 

Throughout her whole high school life she held some class office and in her senior year was an officer of the General Organization, which governs Wadleigh. It is no wonder, then, that this girl on graduating last year received not only the John G. Wight Scholarship, for excellence in scholarship, character, and service to the school, but also the State Scholarship, which is awarded for highest standing in the Regent's examination.

**Image descriptions:** Portraits of three young people: Eugene Mars Martin, a young Black boy in formal clothing holding a violin and bow; Lucile Spence, a seated young Black woman; Roderic Smith, a young Black boy sitting on a pony. 

Lucille is now in Hunter College, getting ready to teach little readers of The Brownies' Book. 

## A medalist

Imagine going to school for 13 years and never missing a single day! That is the record of Lucy Beatrice Miller when she graduated in 1918 from the Daytona, Fla. Normal and Industrial Institute for Negro Youth. Besides, she has been such a good girl that she helped keep the other pupils good and for this she received the O'Neil Medal in 1916. Then, because she has always stood so well in her studies and has behaved herself so nicely, she received the Bethune Medal in 1918. 

How many of you will have a similar record when you graduate? 

## A little businessman

Of course, Roderic is proud of his pony. But if the pony only knew, he would be proud of Broderic. For Roderic, think of it—is only 11 years old; yet he has been selling newspapers for four years! Every week, he sells fifty copies of the *New York News*, 5fifty of the *Amsterdam News* and twenty-five or thirty copies of the *Chicago Defender.* Sometimes he sells monthly magazines and in the summer he peddles refreshments. 

He lived with his grandmother for a while and then he helped her with his earnings. Now he lives with his mother again, and this year he has bought his shoes and suit for school—for, of course he goes to school—he is in Grade 6 B-1. During the month of September, this past year, he was one of nine boys whose names appeared on the Honor Roll. Every Thursday morning he is an early bird reporting to the office of the *New York News* at *five o'clock* where he puts inserts in the papers until eight. Then he goes home, gets his breakfast, cleans up, and gets to school on time. 

Don't you think that the pony and New York City where Roderic lives, and all of us ought to be proud of him? 

## Vivian Juanita Long

This little girl, the only child of Abe M. and Amelia Long, left her parents forever August 15, 1919. She is not really dead, though—she is still living

"In that great cloister's quiet and seclusion, 
By guardian angels led."
