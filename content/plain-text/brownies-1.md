Little people of the month. Um, musician.

Most boys and girls are frightened when they get up to speak a piece at the Sunday. Concert. But Eugene Mars, Martin would not be because he has been used to facing audiences ever since he was very tiny when he was not quite four years old, he played on his little violin in the auditorium of the grand central palace in New York. Since then he has studied at the Institute of musical art in New York. And also under Edwin coats for piano and Conrad see held for the violin. Last year he appeared in Aeolian hall. One of the finest musical auditoriums in the country. This, that was his coming out concert. 

Hasn't he had an interesting life in his 15 years and best of all, he is the champion pitcher on the neighborhood baseball team. A shining example. 

Wouldn't it be wonderful. If every child who reads the Brandy's book should have a record like that. Of Lucille Spence. She came from South Carolina to New York city and has lived there eight years. When she graduated from the grammar school out of a class of 150, she received the gold medal for the highest average in general excellence. But this was only the beginning of Lucille's career. She went to the Wadley high school and they're in her second year as a result of a fine composition. She became a member of the scribes, a literary club, which usually receives only third and fourth year pupils. Later she became a member of the Arista, a club whose members Excel in scholarship and character, and also have a classical club. The Helen is. Lucille wrote a number of short stories, which were published in the owl, the school magazine. Then she wrote and helped produce the first play ever given in Wadley, which had a colored theme and was produced by colored students. Throughout her whole high school life. She held some class office and in her senior year was an officer of the general organization, which governs wildly. It is no wonder then that the, this girl on graduating last year received not only the John G rights scholarship. For excellence in scholarship. Character and service to the school, but also the state scholarship, which is awarded for highest standing in the regions examination.

Images. Portraits of three young people. Eugene Mars, Martin. A young boy, holding a violin and standing. Lucille Spence, a portrait of a black woman.

Seated. Roderick Smith, a portrait of a young black boy. On a small horse. Lucille is now in hunter college, getting ready to teach little readers of the brownies book. 

Uh, medalist. Imagine going to school for 13 years and never missing a single day. That is the record of Lucy Beatrice Miele Miller. When she graduated in 1918 from the Daytona, Florida. Normal and industrial Institute for Negro youth. Besides, she has been such a good girl that she helped keep the other pupils. Good. And for this, she received the O'Neal metal in 1916. Then because she has always stood so well in her studies and has behave yourself so nicely. She received the Beth Yoon medal in 1918. How many of you will have a similar record when you graduate? A little businessman. 

Of course Roderick is proud of his pony. But if the poli only knew he would be proud of Broderick. For rhetoric. Think of it is only 11 years old yet he has been selling newspapers for four years. Every week, he sells 50 copies of the New York news, 50 of the Amsterdam news and 25 or 30 copies of the Chicago defender. Sometimes he sells monthly magazines and in the summer he pedals, refreshments. He lived with his grandmother for a while. And then he helped her with his earnings. Now he lives with his mother again, and this year his, but his shoes and suit for school. For, of course he goes to school. He is in grade six, B one. During the month of September, this past year, he was one of nine boys whose names appeared on the honor roll. Every Thursday morning. He has an early bird reporting to the office of the New York news at five o'clock where he puts inserts in the papers until eight. Then he goes home, gets his breakfast, cleans up and gets to school on time. 

Don't you think that the pony and New York city where Roderick lives and all of us ought to be proud of him?
