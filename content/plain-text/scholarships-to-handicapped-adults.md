We received an interesting letter from Miss Ruth Sesmer telling of the wonderful time she had at Camp Jened last summer. This was the first camping experience this cerebral palsied adult ever had. 

We are quoting from Miss Sesmer's letter.

"I was very happy at Camp Jened and had a marvelous time meeting lots of friends, going swimming, playing shuffleboard, baseball, ping-pong, and roughing it just as it was done in any summer camp. We even went on hikes in wheelchairs. 

I saw how many of the handicapped adults and children including myself made a great deal of progress in helping themselves. I am looking forward to going back this summer and to seeing many of my friends."
