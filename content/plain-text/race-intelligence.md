For a century or more, it has been the dream of those who do not believe Negroes are human, that their wish should find some scientific basis. For years, they depended on the weight of the human brain. Trusting that the alleged underweight of less than a thousand Negro brains. Measured without reference to age stature, nutrition, or cause of death. We'll convince the world that black men simply could not be educated. Today scientists acknowledged that there is no warrant for such a conclusion. And that in any case, the absolute weight of the brain is no criteria and of racial ability. 

Measurements of the bony skeleton followed and great hopes of the scientific demonstration of Reese inferiority were held for a while, but they had to be surrendered. When Zulus and Englishman were found in the same. Dilo. Oh, cephalic class. 

Then came psychology. The children of the public schools were studied and it was discovered that some colored children ranked lower than white children. This gave white satisfaction, even though it was pointed out that the average included most of both races and that considering the educational opportunities and social environment of the races, the differences were measured simply of the ignorance and poverty of the black child surroundings. 

Today, however all is settled. Uh, workable, accurate scientific classification of brainpower has been discovered and by none other than our astute army officers, The tests were in two sets for literate and illiterates and were simplicity itself. For instance, among other things, the literates were asked in three minutes to look at each row of numbers below and on the two dotted lines. Right. The two numbers that should come next. Three. For. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Blank. Blank. 

Eight. Seven. Six. Five four. Three. Blink blink. 

10. 15. 20. 25 30. 35. Blank blank. 

81 27 9. Three. One one third. Blank. Blink. 

One. For 9 16, 25, 36 blank. Blink. 

16 17, 15, 18, 14, 19. Blink. Blink. 

3 6, 8, 16, 18 36 blank blank. 

Illiterates were asked for example, to complete pictures where the net was missing in a tennis court or a ball and a bowling alley. 

For these tests were chosen four hundred and seven forty seven thirty Negroes from Louisiana and Mississippi and 28,052 white recruits from Illinois. The result, do you need to ask. M R Tribu director bureau of educational service. Columbia university assures us that the intelligence of the average Southern Negro is equal to that of a nine year old white boy. And that we should arrange our educational program to make waiters, porters, scavengers, and the like of most Negroes. Is it conceivable that a great university should employ a man whose science consists of such utter rot?
