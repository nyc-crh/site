What you can expect. One of the big questions our counselors ask before campers arrive is what will they be like? And there are some in anxiety in the query. Well, they are warm, responsive children, much like children, whom you already know. The differ in the respect that they happened to have a handicap. Because the child has cerebral palsy, an orthopedic condition. Speech disorder or a visual defect does not negate his being able to adjust to a situation. Many of our campers are well adjusted before they arrive. Others are not so far along. Your job is to help them. They can do many things and can be taught to do many others. Some way. Maybe I just need a spur, which you can provide. Remember. Despite their physical limitations these children can do and want to do just what normal children and other camps do. For this reason, our program is similar to those found in other good modern camps. Greet the children warmly and you'll receive a warm welcome from them. All of this can be the basis for a constructive rewarding summer for all.
