1. Live work, play, eat, and sleep with the children. (Image: 3 stick figures are holding hands and walking)

2. Supervise a bunk. See that the children make their beds, keep the place neat and clean, and write letters home. (Image: drawing of camp building with a flagpole and flag in the front)

3. Mke friends with your group. Lead them, help them see that they mix with each other and the whole camp. (Image: stick figure of a child sitting in someone's lap)

## What YOU can expect:

One of the big questions our counselors ask before campers arrive is, "What will they be like?" And there is some anxiety in the query. Well, they are warm, responsive children, much like children whom you already know. The differ in the respect that they happen to have a handicap. Because a child has cerebral palsy, an orthopedic condition, speech disorder, or a visual defect does not negate his being able to adjust to a situation. Many of our campers are well adjusted before they arrive; others are not so far along. Your job is to help them. They can do many things, and can be taught to do many others. Some may just need a spurâ€”which you can provide. Remember! Despite their physical limitations, these children can do and want to do just what normal children and other camps do. For this reason, our program is similar to those found in other good, modern camps. Greet the children warmly and you'll receive a warm welcome from them. All of this can be the basis for a constructive, rewarding summer for all.
