Double Dutch Championship. By Howie Evans.

A program that began with training sessions throughout the months of March and April reached its culmination this past Saturday on the plaza of Lincoln center.

The Eighth annual World invitational Double Dutch championship finals attracted well over 7,000 spectators during the long, hot and tiring day as a blazing sun hung overhead for the 80 teams of girls (boy) From each borough in the city, New Jersey and Connecticut. 

In reality, most of the participants, young girls of elementary, junior high school, high school age had been practicing all year for the Double Dutch finals. The lone male in the competition was Peter Holloman, a sixth grade student from Brooklyn. Peter jumped with a team that was coached by Larry Jenkins of Brooklyn's PS 268. 

Some of the glimmer of the affair lost its glow because of the length of the program, which included compulsory routines, speed jumping, and freestyle routines for singles, than doubles. The spectacular day of rope jumping, if continued in the future, would best be served by perhaps eliminating more teams during the regional jumpoffs. 

But nevertheless, the activity showcased some 30,000 children in a very highly visible activity that had its roots on the sidewalks of New York. The sport was organized by David Walker and Mike Williams, two Harlem based police officers who came upon the activity as an outlet for girls. The Double Dutch tournament just might be the single most major attraction for girls in the city of New York. 

The sport requires an awesome amount of teamwork with little room for error. The routines are no longer simple. The teams assembled for the competition displayed crowd-roaring dance routines under the ropes. The speed-jumping with many girls jumping as many as 340 counts in two minutes, was spectacular. The count is made by the touching of the left shoe on the pavement. "That's all we can see," mused Mike Williams to the large crowd that completely filled the Lincoln Center Plaza. Williams might have set an endurance record for talking during the long day. 

The Fantastic Four all world champion jumpers, were brought out for a demonstration and left the crowd gasping. They no longer compete. The four girls, Robin Oakes, Dolores Brown, Adrienne Adams, and De'Shone Adams form a team that exemplifies what Double Dutch is all about. 

The activity has been sponsored by the Mobil Oil corporation over the years. But Mobil is withdrawing its corporate sponsorship and a tremendous void will be left if another sponsor is not forthcoming. The McDonalds Corporation, sponsorer of several teams in New York City and Plainfield, New Jersey, supposedly will be looking into picking up the program. But their intent and purpose has not been clear. And rightfully so when you consider the involvement of Mobil down through the years and right up to the end of the 8th World invitational Championships.
