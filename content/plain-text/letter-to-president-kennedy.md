The White House
Washington D.C.

Dear president Kennedy,

As you know, the largest outpouring of Americans of all races, colors, and creeds ever to assemble in our Nation's Capitol will take place on Wednesday, August 28th in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. This action is designed to focus nationwide attention on the plight of millions of Negro Americans. 100 years after Emancipation and to press for a redress of their intolerable grievances in the present session of the Congress.

On behalf of the sponsors of the March: James Farmer, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., John Lewis, Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young, Mathew Ahmann, Reverend Eugene Carson Blake, Rabbi Joachin Prinz, Walter Reuther, and myself, I have been authorized to request an appointment with you on that date.

It is our hope that the sponsoring committee will be afforded an opportunity at such a conference to discuss the program of the March and plans for its implementation by your administration and Congress. In view of the schedule of activities for that date, we would be deeply gratified if such a conference could be arranged for 10:30 A.M. on August 28th.

Very respectfully,

A. Phillip Randolph.
