Editor's note. The following report. Is it an account of the charges brought by a citizens committee? The position of the school authorities and their. Side of the question will be reported next week. By Constance Curtis.

Negro children in New York city are being railroaded into classrooms for mentally retarded and trained for nothing better than the most menial jobs. Such as boot black and brush polisher. Normal children are being viciously. Jim crowed and denied a chance to prepare for higher school application occupations. By a complicated system of retarded classes and the south Jamaica area. According to voluminous lead documented charges made by the better schools coordinating council of south Jamaica. 

Under the directorship of Dr. Richard H Hungerford 50 new classes have been set up in the school system under the bureau of children. Of retarded mental development, C R M D, which provision and the provision in the budget for 33 additional classes in the near future. The majority of these classes are centered in the Negro community in PS 40 and 48. The report states further and are filled with many children who should never have been placed in the retarded mentally category in the first place. Backed with documentation from Dr. Deutsche psychiatrist, Dr. Mamie Phipps Clark psychologist. And a large group of investigators, 20 cases are cited in evidence, all of them, children of normal intelligence or above who have been assigned to CRMD classes. The program of the CRMD does not. The report charges consists of normal classwork geared to the learning ability of the retarded child, but the CRMD has instituted a program aimed at indoctrinate. The child along the lines of training and the lowest level jobs. Uh, janitor school. 

Following intelligence test, which neither make allowance for the emotional makeup of the child being tested, or whether he had a reading difficulty. The children are assigned to the retarded classes. They are taught not general school subjects, but places emphasis upon learning to Polish breasts and serve in the lunchroom. Training in fact, for jobs as dishwashers, rug, cleaners, shoe shine, boys and elevator operators. Investigation by the better bureaus, better schools coordinating council of which Eric Brown is the head disclose. The not only were psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers, notably absent from the program. But that many of the teachers had failed examinations for their regular licenses and had been given licenses to teach children and the CRMD program after a six month course of training. 

The head of the program, Dr. Hungerford stated at a public meeting that private industries, such as the park Davis company had given substantial sums to back the program. The plan, it would appear as much like one headed by Dr. Hunter Hungerford and Detroit. 

Question motives. 

Members of the better schools coordinating council have not only been forced to question the motives of a program, which places, normal children and retarded classes. But the question has not been raised. As to whether or not, this is not a plan to provide cheap labor in the future for some of the private companies who are giving their money. To increase the number of these classes. Proceeding a list of recommendations made to the schools, the coordinating council report states. These children are being railroaded into a program whose motives thus necessarily become suspect. Either the CRN D division pays no attention to environmental factors and instead blandly assumes. That a large percentage of children and depressed areas are naturally of low. Intelligence capacity. Or it has it marked upon a deliberate plan of mass educating such children to accept menial tasks as their life's work. 

Recommendations. 

Included among the recommendations for the elimination of the existing CRMD program are one formation of classes. Small enough to give children individual attention. 

Too. Discontinuance of the present plan of study of the CRMT and institution ever program built on the course of study for all students in the schools. 

Three intensive remedial work centered on children who are really mentally retarded. 

For change the name of the classes so that children will not feel shame at being placed under supervision that is designed to aid them. 

Five educate parents to aid in the program. In the present setup, parents are not even notified that their children have been transferred to these classes. 

Six. Appointment of one full-time sociological sideshow, psychiatric consultant in the schools. 

Seven provide adequate textbooks for the children.
