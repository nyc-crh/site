Statement by Martin H. GerryDirectOr, Office.for Civil RightsDepartment of Health, Educatica andWelfare
yesterday, I met with Chancellor Irving Anker of the NewYork City schoolsystem to advise him of my conclusionthat the achool system is violating civilrights laws which prohibit discrimination againstminority, female, and handi-capped students.
This decision concludes a compliance review of theNew York City,publicschools -- the largest civil rights investigation of a publiceducation insti-tution ever undertaken.The date for completion of thP review was set byUnited States District Court Judge John Sirica as partof an order entered in the,case of Brown v. Mathews.
--SpecifIcallyi we have informed the school system that it hasviolated Title VIof the Civil Rights Act of 19644 which prohibitsdiscrimination on the basis of'rice, color, national origin; Title IX of the EducationAmendments of 1972,which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex;and Section 504 of the Rehabi-litation Act of 1973, which prohibits discriminationagainst physically or men-tally handicapped individuals.
The findings of the review are:
-- Minorities are receivinglower amounts of local resources for basiceduca-tion, in poorer quality facilities which have a morelimited range of curricula.
- Minorities are segregated in elementary school classrooms andspecial edu-cation classes and are given unequal educationalservices.
-- Students whose primarylangauge is other than English are barredfrom mean-ingful participation in education programs.
- - Minority and femalestudents in junior high/intermediate and highschoolsare channeled to less desirable and morerestricted academic, vocational andspecial programs and are provided with lesseffective counseling services.
.
Minority junior high/intermediate and high schoolstudents are treated dif-ferently and more harshly than non-minority studentsdisciplined for the sameoffense.
- 7Non-ambulatory students are given a significantlyshorter instructional day.and are confronted by architectural barrierswhich deny them the opportunity toparticipate fullY in the system's education program.
My office has asked for a plan within 60 dayswhich will remedy the discrimina-tion and provide corrective action.We have offered technical assistance totheschool system in developing a plan to meet therequirements of Title VI, Title IXand Section 504.
