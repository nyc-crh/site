## North to Freedom? 

When Negroes go North, what are they looking for? (bettter jobs, homes, schools, more money) Do you think they find what they're looking for?

Why have they had school boycotts in protest against segregation in Chicago, New York, and Boston? 

Do you have relatives that live in the North, what do they say? 

Is there better housing in the North? Or just overcrowded bad housing?

Is there better jobs? (Median income for Negroes is 1/2 less than for whites) Does it cost more to live in the North? 

In the North, is the Negro really free, really equal, why? Conclude: Negro is a second class citizen all over the United States and can't really escape by going Nort. 

The Secondary set of questions should be raised at this point.
