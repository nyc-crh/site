• A PROPOSALF OR AN INDEPENDENBTO ARDO F EDUCATIONFO R HARLEM
A Draft Prepared by
New York-Harlem CORE
March 1, 1967
For many years the civi 1 ri9hts movement in America addressed itself
singlemindedly to one problem: the desegregation of all aspects of American
society. This goal was predicated on the idea that as an American the black
man had every right to participate -,ithout restrictions in all segments of the
society. There can be no question that in the early days of the movement many
gains were made: It is now possible for a black man to travel Scuth without
having to sleep and eat ,n his car. It is now possible for a few carefully
selected black children to attend integrated schools. Many jobs and opportunities
have opened up in the North. All around one can see evidences of the
work of the early civi I rights movement. But, in this year of 1967, more than
a decade after the movement started ,n Birmingham when a seamstress refused to
move to the back of the bus, people in the movement have taken stock of the
situation of the black man in America and have noted that for all the gains
made, the 1 ives of the masses of black people have remained essentially unchanged.
In searching for the cause of this situation, these new observers
wondered just how the civil rights movement failed; what didn't it do? They
found an answer in the fact that never, during al 1 the years of picketing, of
sit-ins, of petitioning Congress for civi 1 rights bills, during all those years
of labor no one, at any time, gave thought to the psychology of the black man.
No one wondered "Hhat now?" after the desegregation of a cafeteria. In short,
the civil rights movement addressed itself to the surface conditions that contributed
to the black man's second class status, but did not consider any program
that would erase the self-defeating self-hatred that is so prevalent among
black people. Some leaders of the early civi I rights movement are now resting

on their laurels, secure in the false notion that things are getting better all
the time. But things are not getting better; indeed, for many black men, particularly
those in urban areas, they are getting worse. Despite civil rights
bills, despite the poverty program, despite al I the efforts of the old civi I
rights movement, there continues to exist in the black corrnnunities of this
country an atmosphere of powerlessness which wil 1 perpetuate itself forever
unless we strike at the very root of the problem--the black man's image of
himself.
But where to begin? \~e suspect that for many adult members of the black
conmunity it is already too late in the day. He therefore have to look to our
black children and to the schools, the chief molders of their minds, for a
beginning. We look to the schools, however, and we are confronted by a bulwark
of mediocrity, a powerful instrument for perpetuating the very ills we seek to
erase. At this point, despite appearances to the contrary, the school situation
is not beyond hope. \le propose to out I ine in this paper an idea for
bringing about complete change in the Harlem schools. There have been so many
r•oP~~ais prescnt~d to correct the schools, so many analyses made of The
Problem, so many "bold" new concepts studied and forgotten, that one may legitimately
approach any new proposal with a certain amount of cynicism, convinced
that it too wi 11 not solve the problem. We submit, however, that many
programs failed because they were based on utopian or piecemeal concepts that
had absolutely no relation to the reality of 1 ife in Harlem. The children of
the race can no longer be sacrificed while we wait for some distant utopia.
We are hopeful that the proposal to follow wi 1 I be one around which Harlem
parents and all community groups concerned with quality education can rally.

THE SCHOOLS IN HARLEM
Harlem 1s the largest black conmunity in the world, and is many times the
size of many autonomous communities throughout the country. Yet, we have 1n
Harlem a city within a city that has no control over its 0<~n destiny. The
schools in Harlem offer a most dramatic ; llustration of this fact. To repeat
statistics documenting t:1e worsening conditions of Harlem schools is tantamount
to belaboring the obvious. One need only go to statistics compiled by the
Board of Education itself to fino support for the charge of criminally inferior
schools. In every conceivable way, education in Harlem is markedly inferior
to standarcis maintained in schools in surrounding areas. The p;,ysical condition
of the school bui !dings is poor. Cid structures are in constant need of
repair and maintenance becomes an uphi 11 fight to avoici complele obsolescence.
Bu' ldinys which were ,sd~quate decaues ayo ca1111ot meet the present requirements
of space and safety equipment.
The most damaging indictment that can be made of the Harlem schools is
that they are failing to produce students who have a good working knowledge
of the basic skills required to function in this highly competitive society.
Not only are general achievement scores lower than in other sections of the
city, but 85% of the students are at least a year below their supposed grade
level 1n reading, and even lower in mathematics. Moreover, the schools are
failing to provide children with a positive image of themselves and of their
fellow black Americans. Staffed, for the most part, by white, middle-class
teache,rs who bring preconceived notions about the inabi 1 ity of black children .
to learn to the classroom, the schools are little more than mil ls for nourishing
and re-enforcing the self-hatred already harboring in a black child
when he enters school.

Similarities Between School Segregation in Harlem and in the South
For all practical purposes schools in H~rlem are operating under a condition
of segregation, and there is no really valid difference between segregated
schools in the South and segregated schools in the North, for the chief characteristic
of a segregated system is that it is imposed on a group of people and
they have no control over it. They do not control policy or direction and are
powerless to bring about meaningful changes. In New York City, as in the segregated
schools of the South, the people of Harlem have no control over their
schools. As in the South, we have a situation where white overlords are overseeing
the education of black children. T'1e elements of choice and control
are the deciding difference between a system that is segregated from the rest
of the school system and one that is separated from the rest of the school
system. It's an undisputable fact t:,at neither of these elements exists in the
South's segregated schools or in Harlem schools. To entertain the thought that
the segregated schools of the South, in some ways, might have a slight advantage
over the segregated schools of Harlem may be horrifying to some people,
but it is not too far-fetched. In the South, black pupi Is do, after all, get
a chance to see black people ,n positions of authority in the schools. Lest
someone seize upon this last statement with the intention of making capital,
let us hasten to emphasize that we hold no brief for segregated schools, North
or South.
J.!le .. Fai.lY.!:~-to _P ;_chiey~__l.!lt~ated Education
Attempts to integrate the New York City school system have failed completely
and undisputably. He seriously doubt that there is anyone around who
honestly believes that this is a goal that can be reached in the foreseeable
:
•
A PROPOSALF OR AN INDEPENDENBTO ARDO F EDUCATIONFO R HARLEM Page 5
future. Many oi the groups that campaigned for years for this "pie-in-the-sky"
solution to ti1e problem have ended their efforts and have now turned their attention
to the pursuit of quality education. Integration failed in New York
City because of (l) shifts in population and (2) the Board of Education's responsiveness
to pressures from white groups opposed to any integration plan.
This responsiveness was demonstrated again and again during the various campaigns
for integrated schools when even the most half-hearted attempt on the
part of the Board to car,·y out an integration plan was met with instant opposition
from white groups. The Board would then either procrastinate or capitulate
entirely. However desirable a goal integration may be for the future, its pursuit
today will continue to end in failure.
The Fi!ilure of C0mpensated Education
In a recent report, the Civil Rights Comnission noted that special programs
such as New York's Higher Horizons consisted "more of sho•,imanship than
sol id education" and that some of them "may be trauC:ulent window-dressing to
divert Mcgro parents who want a fair deal for their children."
The various special programs instituted by the Board of Education have
failed. The reason can be found in the f-:ct that these exercises in pacification
were panaceas that did not take ccgnizance of the larger problem. Like
the doctor who doesn't really know what is wrong with his patient and decides
to pacify him with an innocuous drug, special programs are simply an i llustration
of the extent of the system's lack of understanding of what is needed in
the Harlem schools.
THE SOLUTION
It stands clear that any idea for improving the schools in Harlem is
doomed to fai 1 if the idea is to be carried out under the Board of Education
s

as it ,s presently structured. T;ie educational system of N-w York City is
large and cumbersome to administer. It is an old institution run by a settled
and conservative bureaucracy that is inflexible and averse to change. Faced
with running the world's largest school system, the Board has shown a singular
lack of vision in dealing with the portion that is Harlem. T;,e tloard responds
quickly and tavorably to the white majority, and makes as few concessions as
possible to the black minority. In :~arlem the Board is confronted by a group
that is different from most of the peep 1 e to ~1hom it is respons i b I e, and, more
importantly, has less power. Tile Board has not met this challenge, and it no1~
appears that it wi I I never have the wi 11, the understanding, or the know-how
to do so. In short, the Soard has abdicated its responsibi 1 ity to t,,e Harlem
community and should therefore be replaced by an independent board of education
-for Harlem.
f,n independent board of education for Harlem can be effective on bringing
about changes needed to improve the schools because:
I. It will not be confronted with two groups with conflicting
interests.
2. It will not be the entrenched bureaucracy that is the
main drawback of the present Board. As a result, it
will be completely open to new ideas, new programs,
and new concepts that may seem like heresy if viewed
in I ight of the standards maintained by ti1e present
system.
3. The people themselves wi I I not feel that they are dealing
with an alien group that does not have their best interest
at heart, and wi 11 therefore be more I ikely to participate
actively in the building of better schools.
