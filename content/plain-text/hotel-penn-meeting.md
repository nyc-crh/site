Teachers' union hears of crowded conditions, vicious zoning, outworn facilities, and biased, vocational advice. 

The plate of the Negro school, children in Harlem was put squarely up to the teacher's union in New York, Saturday by the Reverend Adam C. Powell Jr. Assistant pastor of a Baptist church, Dr. Otto, Kleinberg of Columbia university. And other speakers at a conference held by the union and the hotel, Pennsylvania. 

The problems of the Harlem schools and their pupils were discussed under these headings. Do Negro children require special consideration. Are there factors within the educational system, which reflect race, prejudice. How do facilities in Harlem compare with other schools? How far can the problem of the Negro in the schools be treated independently of the special economic conditions? Of the Negro population in Harlem. 

Reverend Mr. Powell praising the teacher's union for devoting one of its discussion periods to the school conditions in Harlem said it is timely that the teacher's union is dedicating one of its discussions to the problem of education in Harlem. These problems have gone unheated too long and can only be solved by a mass attack of both Negros and whites. Condemns discrimination. 

Race prejudice is rampant in the school system. He continued vigorously condemning the school system because of discrimination. It is seen in the attitude towards, and treatment of the school children in Harlem, as well as in the, in ordinarily poor school facilities in that section. Mass action on the part of all the people, regardless of color is the only solution of the serious problems. And in the Harlem schools. Dr. Kleinberg noted psychologist at Columbia said. The problem of liberal racial attitudes rests mainly upon the teachers who instruct children in their most formative years. It is during childhood that lasting impressions are made and we cannot start too early with any program of education. 

There are a few existing situations, more unreasonable in their implications are more dangerous in their possibilities than the racial, particularly the Negro problem in the United States. He declared.

## Sees Principles Violated.

Ms. Lucille Spence, instructor of biology and Wadley high school and chairman of the teacher's union, Harlem committee said. The present conditions in Harlem violate the principles of democracy. And are creating fertile ground for the seeds of race prejudice. The board of education has met conditions in the Harlem schools and a procurator way. Crowded classes without worn facilities, a vicious zoning regulation for high school. And junior high school students and biased and restricted vocational advice for pupils with reduced vocational opportunities. 

The result of the continued neglect of this group is the heart of New York pres presents a challenging situation for the educator. Who sees the fruit of such neglect.
