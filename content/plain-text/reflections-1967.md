Sex. The main question that arose from this session was: 'Was sex a privilege and enjoyment to be indulged in before one has the white Piece of Paper Stating a Legal Marriage?'

In conclusion, one can realize that this group covers an enormous scope of interrelated topics that affect us now and will continue to do so for years to come.

Tori Feinstein, Music Club

The purpose of this club was to introduce various types of music to campers, to teach them new songs, and, in general, to have them participate in a musical type of program. We established a jug band and performed as a welcoming group for Cousin Brucie and Camp Tel Ari. This hobby was a learning and a fun experience rolled into one.

The artists

Campers who were particularly active creative and who enjoyed the arts and crafts belong to the arts and crafts club. One camper, drew portraits of the other members of the group. Others made useful items, such as ashtrays and hot plates with tiles and scrapbooks. Leather work has become particularly popular. We all enjoyed hobby period very much because we had a longer time to finish our projects and it chance to choose what we wanted to do. 

Anita Horowitz cooking

And cooking. We learned the importance of careful measuring and the preparation of foods. 

At each meeting, the members were divided into small groups, each assigned to their own tasks. One group would measure the ingredients. Another would mix them. And finally, the mixture was baked. Our project's varied from reason cookies to orange flavored cake. The cooking sessions gave the members a knowledge of food preparation that they could use for the future. Gary. Jerkins tell RAs, visit. 

On Sunday, the 20th camp till Ari came to Jeanette, a spirit of tad. A spirit of time is had by all, whenever this camp comes and this was no exception. Songs and dances were exchanged by the campers of both camps. The wheelchair fashion show gave gen ed a chance to entertain and show off the ingenuity of our campers. The tell Ari campers were not at all hesitant to talk about the purpose of their camp and the goals of the movement to which it belongs. I personally found it very inspiring to do so. So many people from all over the country, so dedicated to one cause. I'm sure I speak for all 60 16 camp. When I say that I would welcome. Tell are you back anytime? Alan Kaplan, Abel ARD. 

For an original evening activity, we invited at camp to entertain us the name of the campus avalard they performed for all of the team camp. They played a variety of music. And that seemed to please everyone. In fact one is from my Homeland, which as you know, is Canada. The city was Montreal. Robin Browder the campfire. 

At camp gen ed, we have campfires. Gene makes the fire. He always makes a good fire. All of team camp sites. And it sits in a circle around the fire. We sing songs, the fire was hot and it keeps us warm. I like campfires. Then said David counselor baseball. The long-awaited baseball game finally came on Monday afternoon. The girls were up first, they brought in several home, runs to our surprise. The game was really moving the counselors and campers cheered each other. Hilariously. Out winters was the catcher on the boys team. The boys really had to struggle into victory, thus ending the exciting game with a score of eight to seven. This all goes to show that women have the ability to handle the boys in a major league baseball game. All I say is if the girls would have won, it would have been quite embarrassing for the boys. Judy Beasley cousin Brucey. On Saturday, August 19th. Bruce Morrow, better known to his devoted listeners as cousin Brucey. Came to camp gen ed, although he was late. He's only human too, you know? He came into camp with a burst of enthusiasm that really impressed everyone. After speaking to our campers and guests from camp evil ARD, he loved several of the younger campers at a song. He then went into the audience and autographs pictures of himself that he had given out earlier. He had to leave very early in order to get back to New York, to do his show, but he left many gifts, including many hit records, which were distributed to the campers. Because of Bruce's visit did not really end when he left camp. For him mentioned jet on his radio show that night. We could tell by what he said, that he was as impressed with us as we were with him. And we all hope that he'll be able to honor his promise and return next year. Carolyn Becca Olympics. 

Jeanette's annual. We hope Olympics were held last Tuesday, August 22nd. Joan and Maryland divided the teams into five teams, according to the abilities of campers and all participated in activities, fringing from wheelchair, obstacle courses, and races to balloon shaving. Pie eating and javelin throwing. All the campers enjoyed themselves win or lose because each was given a chance to help his teams cause by doing his best and the various competitions. 

Many campers. So caught up in the spirit of the Olympics, walked in wheeled better than. They themselves ever thought they could. And this way, besides being a source of enjoyment to everyone, this activity produced concrete results in terms of physical improvement by many of our campers.
