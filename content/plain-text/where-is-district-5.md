Where·Is District 5?
More than a year and a half ago I resigned lrom Community School board Dd5 after trying vainly to accomplish what I thought was a mandate from my fellow Harlemites; namely, to do something toward improving education for our children.
  Now I'm asked to serv~ on a temporary
board of !nlSlees In that same
area after Ille suspension ol &he elect•
ed school board by ChanceUor Irving
Anker.
I'm considering it only because of
my concern for the children of this
community and my not wanting to
have to face myseU for rel\lslng to try
to help In spite ol the mess I did not
create nor am I certain of any real
power to correct it. Moreover, I would
do It with great reluctance and apprehension
that accepting it may be a
bad mistake.
The reasons for the reluctance and
apprehension are basically the same
,as those for the resignation. (lnciden•
tally, my successor, Lloyd Dickens,
also resigned for many of the same
reasons.) Basically, we use tl1e word
"education" In our talking, but the
·reality is money, Jobs, power and
prestige, politics. This is true on top,
in lhe middle, and on the bottom. St>ecifically:
1. The law establishing community
school boards never intended nor
planned· for real community rontrol.
• 11 simply created a kind of buffer
between the real power and a growing
vocal minority. The power remained
the same simply shifting lrom time to
time the realatlonshlp between the
polilital«onomlc•labor-admlnlstra•
tion rorcn.
• 2. I expect elected officials to be
• interested In education In their dis·
tr:icts. But, I did not expect education-
al decisions to be su.bcirdinated to
'their other interests; school board
ollicers, school superintendents, an•
• cillary positions in the district to be
• decided in pdlltical club rooms. Nor
did I expect certain politicians to be
'.'actively engaged in manipulating
,; board members and selecting posi•
lions on the board. The possibility for
sellout of the children became more
real to the extent that som,, of the
politicians may be too lndebled to the
United Federation of Teachers.
3. I expect It.at as a union, the
U.F. T. must fight to protect and acquire
jobs and provide for the best
working condition of Its membership.
But. I did not e,cpect that the U.F.T.
would be fielding slates for community
school boards, using money and
persoMel to elect people beholding to
itself, and picking board officers at
cheap luncheons.
Moreover. when I consider the general
membership of the U.F.T. and
general membership ol the City's
public schools, I hardly suspect that
the best Interests of the latter would
coincide with the best interests ol the
U.F.T.

4. Whileh aving the greatest respect
for some board members, it is also
true that many came on as handpicked
candidates of the U.F.T. and
certain politicians or were indebted to
politicians for other j?bs. Instead of
making serious education ol our own
children utmost priority, we came as
part ol the system or the American
bag. •
Education became a poor second at
best to contracts, jobs, my man or
woman in this job. this program
belongs to you or this group and
another belongs to you and that group.

(qualified or not qualified), cowardice
to take a stand for rear of being

NotSlealiDg
Whatever the charge of misman•
agement of funds. I do not believe it
has anything to do with out and out
stealing. What probably is at issue is
the non use ol funds as directed
perhaps from on high. What criteria
the chancellor used ror choosing the
trustees I do not know. Hopefully the
board of trustees will not be expected
to be mindless Charley McCarthles
who will simply rubber-stamp the
wi$he$ of Central Board, U.F.T. and
the political and economic Interests
that be.
I expect that they have chosen
people of maturity atid intelligence,
educated and interested in the education
of children and the development
of their minds. It is expected that they
Will be given all the authority, free,
dom, and power required for working
with the community in order to bring

Part of Problem
The Harlem community supposedly
served by District &65 doesn't have
lOO much to be proud about Ji this
regard either. Less than 1% of eligible
voters vote in any school board elec•
tion. Of these, many voted on the basis
of friendship or worse on the promise,
real or imaginary, of jobs or positions.
Many having voted believed that
they had done all that could be ex-
•
peeled. Community school board
meetings are r~latively poorly at•
tended. Most of those attending are
job seekers, Job ~rservers, revenge
seekers, or those possessing some
particular ax.es 10 grind. School board
members if so inclined or big-mouth
manipulators could disrupt any meet•
ing with a small group of lollowi,rs for
their particular interests.
e,P,T.A. ollicers were ollcn conspi-.
cously employed in the district a1
times making it dillicult to di~tinguish
whether it were the children or the
jobs that were more lmponant. Most
Harlemites would not be caught dead
at a school board meeting or P.T.A.
meetings of schools where their own
children attend. In short. the Harlem
Community does not see education .is
a greater prior:ity than America does
as a whole.
This too, is part ol a problem of
