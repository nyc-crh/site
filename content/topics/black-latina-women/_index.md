This collection explores Black and Latina women’s education advocacy in New York City from  from the late 1800s to the present.

Histories of the civil rights movement tend to emphasize charismatic male leadership, like that of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and pay much less attention to Black and Latina women.{{< detail-tag "Read more" >}}[^1] They also tend to focus on activism against racism and racial segregation more than struggles against ableism and for disability rights. And when they do document disability rights struggles, they tend to focus on white activists and white disabled people rather than Black or Latinx disabled people and activists. Accounts of this history almost always neglect the ways that racism and ableism have been connected over time, and how some activists fought against both together.[^2]

Black and Latina women saw that segregation was a problem in their city. They identified a range of racist and ableist policies that caused it. And they found multiple ways to challenge them. They went to court, organized boycotts, demanded policy changes, pushed for new opportunities for their community’s children, advocated for their own children, and much more. Some created educational spaces within their activist groups. Some did this work as parents, some as teachers, and some as community organizers. Some were all three.

In each document set you will see an image of the activist or activists. These images make us think about representation - meaning how people present themselves to others and how they are represented by others. How do the different women in these portraits choose to represent themselves? Or, who chose to represent these women, how, and why? How do representations matter for how we understand the past, and how we think about the present?

Scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw provided the term “intersectionality” to describe the ways racism, sexism, classism, ableism,and other forms of discrimination intersect, interact, and overlap with one another.[^3] For example, Black women face both racism and sexism not as separate challenges, but in connection with one another. Sexuality and gender identity also interact with racism and sexism. Black or Latina women who are disabled experience ableism and disability differently than their white peers, for example. As you read about each of these women’s lives, consider how they experienced multiple oppressions, shaped their own identities, and decided how they would fight for justice. How do their experiences and their ambitions feel similar to, or different from, yours today?
