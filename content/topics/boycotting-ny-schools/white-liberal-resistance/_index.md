White New Yorkers were relentless in opposing desegregation. Even very small-scale attempts by the Board of Education to desegregate schools - like programs that involved shifting only a few hundred Black students to majority white schools - prompted protests and backlash.[^1] The white media criticized civil rights organizing, calling the boycott “tragically misguided.” Polls conducted by *The New York Times* showed that 57 percent of New Yorkers thought the civil rights movement had gone too far and was moving “too fast” - even though New York had made almost no progress on school desegregation.[^2]
