The New York City school boycotts were part of a long tradition of mass protest in the U.S., including labor strikes and civil rights actions in the South like the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the lunch-counter sit-ins. Such major actions required extensive work in advance and behind the scenes.[^1]  Leaders helped build solidarity, at times building relationships across groups who had different interests or had not previously worked together. They also had to figure out how major events with tens or even hundreds of thousands of people would work. Who would go where, what would they do, who would speak, how would everyone stay safe? The networks, strategies, and knowledge that earlier organizers cultivated helped make the New York City school boycotts possible.
