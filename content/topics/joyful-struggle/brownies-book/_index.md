In October 1919, W.E.B. Du Bois and his collaborators at *Crisis* (the NAACP’s official magazine) proposed that they publish a new magazine. They outlined seven objectives. (Note that they used the language of their time to describe children they would call Black or African-American today):

> “(a) To make colored children realize that being “colored” is a normal, beautiful thing.
>
> (b) To make them familiar with the history and achievements of the Negro race.
>
> (c) To make them know that other colored children have grown into beautiful, useful and famous persons.
>
> (d) To teach them delicately a code of honor and action in their relations with white children.
>
 > (e) To turn their little hurts and resentments into emulation, ambition and love of their own homes and companions.
>
> (f) To point out the best amusements and joys and worth-while things of life.
>
> (g) To inspire them to prepare for definite occupations and duties with a broad spirit of sacrifice.”[^1]

These goals were especially important given how many kinds of mainstream media at the time—from literature to textbooks to theater to visual art—offered racist portrayals of Black people.[^2]  

This new Black-led magazine, named *The Brownies’ Book*, was published from January 1920 until December 1921 and distributed to subscribers for the cost of $1.50/year or 15 cents per month. You can read the whole series at the [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/item/22001351/).[^3]

W.E.B. Du Bois and the NAACP were not the only Black writers working to offer Black children affirming and accurate representations of their lives and history. For example, the poet Langston Hughes wrote a textbook in the 1950s to counter the absence or misrepresentation of Black history in what students read in school.[^4]
