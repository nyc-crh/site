New York’s population has often grown via immigration and migration. In the mid-1800s, the city saw large immigrant communities arrive from Ireland and Germany. In the later decades, from the 1880s onward, new waves of immigrants came from Italy, Russia, and other southern and eastern European countries. Immigrants sought relief from political and religious persecution and for opportunities for employment that would help them move out of poverty. In the early 20th century, these European immigrants who would later be identified as white were joined by Black people who were immigrating from the Caribbean or migrating from the US. South. Between 1870 and 1910, New York's population grew from less than a million people to more than 4.7 million—with foreign immigration making up about 40% of the increase.[^1] Immigrant and migrant New Yorkers expanded the city, helped fill jobs in the growing economy, and provided large numbers of new students who needed to go to school.

From the 1840s to the 1870s, all New York voters (all male citizens, at the time) could vote for local school board members, and these boards hired teachers and principals. But should regular New Yorkers have this power? Elite white New Yorkers argued that they were the ones who held the expertise and insight to make decisions about schools - not the city’s expanding immigrant and migrant communities. They were part of a wave of “Progressive” reformers who were confident that their ideas could improve city government - in health, in housing, in schooling - for the lives of people living there.

These advocates for Progressive reform, who were at the time predominantly white, Protestant Christian, and wealthy, pushed to centralize education decision-making in a new citywide school board controlled by the mayor and a board-appointed superintendent. This board would then depend on education experts to lead the school system and make schools more effective for “the masses.”[^2] Some elements of this system went into effect in the 1870s, and a highly centralized form of school governance was in place in New York City from 1902 to 1969.

A centralized system did not mean that all New Yorkers experienced the same opportunities at school. Because the city’s population was growing so rapidly, many schools were overcrowded. The school system built many new school buildings in neighborhoods serving growing white communities, but not in Black neighborhoods. In Harlem, for example, parents, teachers, and community advocates used several different means of protest to draw attention to conditions in their school, and to identify how the Board of Education segregated schools by race even though New York law no longer permitted legal segregation [link to Elizabeth Cisco doc set]. Black New Yorkers were frustrated by how unresponsive the centralized school system was to the needs of their children.
