In the 1980s and 1990s, many city school systems around the country were struggling. They did not have enough resources, and many students were not learning as much as they should have been. Some people said the problem was how schools were governed. Decentralized control had been messy, with too many people weighing in on decisions. (Often, these people seemed to imply that urban residents, many of whom were working-class Black and Latinx people, couldn’t be trusted to govern their own schools).  The system was inefficient, and at worst created opportunities for corruption.[^1] They said that a more centralized decision making structure, with more power in the hands of professional managers who knew how to run big systems like businesses, would help improve school performance. Mayor Michael Bloomberg agreed with this argument, and in 2002 he persuaded the state legislature to give him power to shape a new, very centralized, system of control of NYC schools.

Domingo Morel, a political science professor, studied state and mayoral takeovers of city school systems from the 1980s until 2013. He found that predominantly Black school districts are more likely to be taken over than those with predominantly white students and that cities with higher levels of Black representation on city council were more likely to face takeovers from state legislators. Morel argues that removing local democratic power over school systems in Black and Latinx communities has been part of a broader effort to depoliticize those communities who have historically attained political power through municipal politics, particularly those related to school governance.[^2]

Under mayoral control, New York City’s newly-named Department of Education supported the expansion of school choice. School choice grew in two ways: the creation of many new small schools of choice that students are assigned to not on the basis of where they live, but based on their preference where to attend and whether they meet the school’s entry requirements, and the opening of new charter schools, which were funded with public dollars but that were governed by private boards.

Mayoral control is not a permanent part of state law, but is subject to renewal every few years. In late 2023 and early 2024, New York residents are participating in [a series of hearings to discuss mayoral control and its future](https://www.nysed.gov/new-york-city-mayoral-control-hearings).
